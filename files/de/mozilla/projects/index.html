Scripting for Midas is based on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533049.aspx">DHTML commands</a> supported by Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer supports the ability to make an entire document editable by setting the <code>designMode</code> property of the <a href="/de/docs/Web/API/Document" title="Each web page loaded in the browser has its own document object. The Document interface serves as an entry point into the web page's content (the DOM tree, including elements such as &lt;body> and &lt;table>) and provides functionality which is global to the document (such as obtaining the page's URL and creating new elements in the document)."><code>document</code></a> object; this is how Midas is invoked in Gecko. Internet Explorer also supports the ability to edit specific elements using the <code>contentEditable</code> attribute; Starting with Firefox 3, Gecko also supports <code>contentEditable</code>. Once Midas is invoked, a few more methods of the <code>document</code> object become available.</dd></dl></dl></div>
