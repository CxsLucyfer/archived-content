<h2 id="RSS_Proposal_List" name="RSS_Proposal_List"> RSS Proposal List </h2>
<p>Below is a list of proposals people or companies have made for RSS. Non of these are widely adopted standards. (So don't expect any software to support them.) But some of them could become standards in the future.
</p>
<div class="note">
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Those in the list below that are marked "In Development" should NOT be implemented. "In Development" means that they are still working on it and trying to come up with a draft. Those labeled with "Draft Exists" can be implemented, but be warned that they could radically change.
