<p>There are two main components that come into play with RSS syndication: the <em>server</em> end and the <em>client</em> end.</p>

<p>The <em>server</em> end of RSS Syndication is the part of the system that produces the RSS feed. A news website would be at the <em>server</em> end of RSS syndication. A blog would be at the <em>server</em> end of RSS syndication. An IPradio show would be at the <em>server</em> end of RSS syndication. An IPTV show would be at the <em>server</em> end of RSS syndication.</p>

<p>The <em>client</em> end of RSS syndication is the part of the system that consumes the RSS feed. The Mozilla Firefox web browser would be at the <em>client</em> end of the RSS syndication. A desktop RSS aggregator would be at the <em>client</em> end of the RSS syndication. A web-based RSS aggregator would be at the <em>client</em> end of the RSS syndication.</p>
