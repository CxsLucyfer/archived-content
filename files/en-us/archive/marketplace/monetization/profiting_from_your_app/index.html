<div class="deprecated notecard">
<p><strong>Marketplace feature removal</strong><br>
 The functionality described on this page no longer works — Firefox Marketplace has discontinued support for Android, Desktop, Tablets, and payments (and other related functionality). For more information, read the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Marketplace/FutureofMarketplaceFAQ">Future of Marketplace FAQ</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="summary">Creating Web Apps is not only fun; it&apos;s also a great way to turn your passion into revenue! This article sumarizes how you publish app using various the monetization models available.</p>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you&apos;re looking for more information on monetization models or advice on which one to use, check out <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Prepare/Choosing_your_business_model">Choosing your business model</a>. In addition, the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/FAQ#Payments">payments section of the Marketplace FAQ</a> provides answers to many common questions about Marketplace payments.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="How_to_...">How to ...</h2>

<h3 id="Release_a_premium_app">Release a premium app</h3>

<p>To offer a premium (paid) app you need to set it so it&apos;s installed from Firefox Marketplace. Then include code to verify a receipt issued by Marketplace, to make sure the app has been paid for before allowing it to run. For more information, see the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/App_payments_guide">App payments guide</a>.</p>

<p>To setup an app as premium in Firefox Marketplace you first identify it as Paid in the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Submit/Load_your_app#Monetization">initial (monetization)</a> section of the Submit an App page. You then <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Pricing/Payment_Accounts">create an account with one or more payment providers</a>. Once this is done you can select a <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/App_pricing">price point</a> for your app. Bear in mind that currently only apps installed into Firefox OS can be premium apps, because payments are not yet supported on desktop or Android.</p>

<h3 id="Release_a_promote_as_upgrade_app">Release a promote as upgrade app</h3>

<p>For this approach you obviously need two apps — the free one and the premium app you&apos;ll promote as an upgrade.</p>

<p>Once your apps are ready, first add the free version of the app to Firefox Marketplace, then the premium version. While submitting the premium app select the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Pricing/Promote_as_upgrade_to_free_version">promote as upgrade to free version</a> option at the bottom of the <strong>Compatibility &amp; Pricing</strong> page.</p>

<h3 id="Release_an_app_with_in-app_payments">Release an app with in-app payments</h3>

<p>You have two options for adding in-app payments to your apps: <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/In-app_payments_section/fxPay_iap">fxPay</a> and <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/In-app_payments_section/mozPay_iap">mozPay</a>. The principal difference between the two options is that fxPay works without the need for your own server, while mozPay requires you to have a server to store transaction receipts.</p>

<p>In simple terms, development of your app involves defining a number of in-app products you have for sale, reading those products into your app, providing a purchase &apos;button&apos;, and validating the receipt when the product is &apos;consumed&apos; to ensure it was validly purchased. Full details on the coding required is provided in the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/In-app_payments_section/Introduction_In-app_Payments">In-app payments</a> section.</p>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: While we encourage apps using in-app payments to be free for download, it&apos;s possible to have a paid app that also uses in-app payments.</p>
</div>

<p>To setup an app with in-app purchases in Firefox Marketplace, you first identify it as <strong>Paid / In-app</strong> in the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Submit/Load_your_app#Monetization">initial (monetization)</a> section of the Submit an App page (noting that you will do this for a stub app before development starts to get a API key for mozPay or load in-app products for fxPay). You then <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Pricing/Payment_Accounts">create an account with one or more payment providers</a>, before publishing your app. Bear in mind that currently only apps installed into Firefox OS can be premium apps, because payments are not yet supported on desktop or Android.</p>

<h3 id="Releasing_an_app_with_in-app_advertising">Releasing an app with in-app advertising</h3>

<p>Mozilla has no special relationship with any advertising network, so you are free to choose the ad network or networks. You&apos;ll need to consult the developer resources from your chosen network to get full details of the development process, but in general the process is likely to involve: getting a key that will identify to the network that an ad has been displayed or clicked in your app, and coding the ads into your app.</p>

<p>To publish on Firefox Marketplace you now simply identify it as <strong>Free</strong> or <strong>Paid / In-app</strong> as appropriate in the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Submit/Load_your_app#Monetization">initial (monetization)</a> section of the Submit an App page and compete the apps details. There are no special steps to follow, compared to posting an app without in-app adverts.</p>
