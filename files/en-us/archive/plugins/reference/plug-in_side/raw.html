<p><span class="seoSummary">This chapter describes methods in the plug-in API that are available from the plug-in object; these allow plug-ins to interact with the browser. The names of all of these methods begin with <code>NPP_</code> to indicate that they are implemented by the plug-in and called by the browser.</span> For an overview of how these two sides of the plug-in API interact, see the How Plug-ins Work and Overview of Plug-in Structure sections in the introduction.</p>
