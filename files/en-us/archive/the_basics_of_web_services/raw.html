<h3 id="The_Basics" name="The_Basics">The Basics</h3>

<p>Web services are not really anything that new, and actually, if you've ever used an RSS or Atom feed to pull news from a website, you have an idea of how a web service might work.</p>

<p>Web services exchange data from a server to a client, using an XML format to send requests, so both the server and the client can understand each other. (<a href="/en/XML_Introduction" title="en/XML_Introduction">XML Introduction</a>).</p>

<p>A better way to understand a web service is to compare it to a HTML form communication with a server side script (such as PHP or ASP) to post and send data. Both web services and forms send and receive requests. The only major difference is that a web service uses XML.</p>

<p>As said before, RSS and Atom feeds are a simple example of how a web service works, most commonly, XML-RPC or SOAP are also used to communicate between a server and a client.</p>

<h3 id="Introducing_XML-RPC" name="Introducing_XML-RPC">Introducing XML-RPC</h3>

<p>XML-RPC is a type of web service and has been around since 1998, though not an official <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> standard, it is widely used. XML-RPC was developed by Useful Inc, along with Microsoft.</p>

<h3 id="Introducing_SOAP" name="Introducing_SOAP">Introducing SOAP</h3>

<p>SOAP, a web service, is listed as a <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> standard, and is similar in ways to XML-RPC. SOAP also has backing from IBM, as well as Microsoft.</p>

<h3 id="SOAP_or_XML-RPC.3F" name="SOAP_or_XML-RPC.3F">SOAP or XML-RPC?</h3>

<p>Briefly, SOAP was intended to fill gaps in XML-RPC. An example is, it is easier to send a multi-dimensional array with SOAP rather then with XML-RPC. SOAP also has more features then XML-RPC, but XML-RPC on its own, has its uses.</p>
