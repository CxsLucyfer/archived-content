<ul><li> Discussion about possibility of implementing Java technology in Mozilla products.
</li><li> A user writes that the licensing incompatibilities between GPL and MPL would prevent Java code to be added in Mozilla. The license would need to be compatible with all three MPL/GPL/LGPL (used by Tamarin) to be considered for Mozilla.
</li><li> Frank Hecker writes: The possibility of having a GPL-only Mozilla code would cause problems such as people who want to distribute Mozilla based products with:
<ul><li> non-GPL compatible extensions </li><li> free proprietary extensions such as Flash player
</li><li> using trademarks such as logos
</li></ul>
