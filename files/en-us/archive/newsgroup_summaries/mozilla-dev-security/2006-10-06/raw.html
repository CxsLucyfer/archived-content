<h5 id="Protocol_Handlers" name="Protocol_Handlers"> <a class="external" href="http://groups.google.ca/group/mozilla.dev.security/browse_thread/thread/12865f7c888c3745/d961b621877aeb47#d961b621877aeb47">Protocol Handlers</a> </h5>
<p><a class="external" href="http://groups.google.ca/groups/profile?enc_user=uTE3_xAAAABbfe0nxAbQRmc4zUnzIcTO">Boris Zbarsky</a> posed the question, Should random webpages have access to the following protocols: feed, pcast, moz-bookmark, webcal, swebcal.
As well as any protocols that you have implemented and are <b>NOT</b> in the list of protocols nsScriptSecurityManager::CheckLoadURI
</p>
<h6 id="feed:" name="feed:"> feed: </h6>
<p>Consensus is that it should be allowed and treated as an ordinary link.
</p>
<h6 id="pcast:" name="pcast:"> pcast: </h6>
<p>Similar to feed: just differentiating between different types of feeds and should be allowed access.
</p>
<h6 id="moz-bookmark:" name="moz-bookmark:"> moz-bookmark: </h6>
<p>Protocol is defunct, apparently Ben Goodger disabled it back in 12/2003, shortly after he added it.
</p>
<h6 id="webcal:_&amp;_swebcal:" name="webcal:_&amp;_swebcal:"> webcal: &amp; swebcal: </h6>
<p>Should also be allowed as the security manager doesn't differentiate between access types. </p>
<h6 id="Other" name="Other"> Other </h6>
<p>This is for allowing protocol handlers to define a custom security model (see bug <a class="link-https" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120373">120373</a>). There is no consensus in the posts as to if this should be allowed.
