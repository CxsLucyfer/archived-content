</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><ol><li> search the filesystem for unneeded files </li><li> delete or archive them, add a hard disk, move all or part of the concerned filesystem there </li><li> move that tinderbox to a different machine with more empty disk space </li></ol>

Nick stated that the build engineers knew that there was a problem with the tinderbox and that they would be solving the problem by adding a hard disk, and moving all or part of the concerned filesystem there.

Cédric's posting was about a French site which had already announced the availablity of FF 2.0 final release and provided download links, even though the release was on October 24. The owner of the site probably browsed on the releases/2.0 dir on the ftp and got the releases, which is kind of unpolite. Cédric wanted to know if the release directory should be closed before a major release to avoid this kind of thing to happen.
</li><li> Axel responded by stating that Cédric should send them a nice note to correct that.

Paul suggested that the best way to deal with this would be to ask people to wait, and let them know that they're degrading their user experience.

Urk stated that currently Fedora has their release 6 directory locked out with access forbidden via web and FTP while the mirrors are mirroring for the release tuesday.
