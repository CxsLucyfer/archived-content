He wants to be able to build applications that will run inside the browser. Nickolay Ponomarev, Benjamin Smedberg, Axel Hecht clarify some misconceptions about front-end and back-end programming with Xulrunner, including the difficulty of writing the backends in C++ (since that would require a recompilation on every platform Frank wanted to support).
