                      <p><a href="https://github.com/mixedpuppy/socialapi-demo" title="https://github.com/mixedpuppy/socialapi-demo">https://github.com/mixedpuppy/socialapi-demo</a> contains a test provider implementation that demonstrates the use of many of these APIs. Reading through it will help illustrate the documentation provided here.</p>
                      <h3 id="Service_Worker_Reference">Service Worker Reference</h3>
                      <p>A Service Worker inherits all the limitations and behaviors available to HTML5 Shared Workers. It can create XMLHttpRequests, use WebSockets, receive messages from windows and the browser, use IndexedDB, and post messages to other windows.</p>
                      <p>The Worker can use the <code>ononline</code>, <code>onoffline</code>, and <code>navigator.online</code> methods and properties that are available to all Workers to obtain notification of the browser's online/offline status.</p>
                      <p>In addition to the standard methods, Service Workers have access to additional functionality, all of which are implemented using messages sent and received by worker "message ports". As message ports are inherently asynchronous, any message that requires a response will involve two messages - one for the request and one for the response. Not all message require a response - this is part of the message specification. Messages which don't require a response are analogous to an unsolicitied 'event'. If a message does require a response, then the response must always be sent on the same port as the request and in general, the 'topic' of the response will be the topic of the request with "-response" appended.</p>
                      <p>Service workers are expected to provide a function at global scope, named <code>onconnect</code>. The browser will invoke <code>onconnect</code> at startup time, passing in an event. The worker should access the <code>ports</code> property of this event to extract a stable communication port back to the browser, and persist it for the life of the worker, like this:</p>
                      <pre><code>var apiPort;
var ports = [];
onconnect = function(e) {
    var port = e.ports[0];
    ports.push(port);
    port.onmessage = function (msgEvent)
    {
        var msg = msgEvent.data;
        if (msg.topic == "social.port-closing") {
            if (port == apiPort) {
                apiPort.close();
                apiPort = null;
            }
            return;
        }
        if (msg.topic == "social.initialize") {
            apiPort = port;
            initializeAmbientNotifications();
        }
    }
}

// send a message to all provider content
function broadcast(topic, data) {
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; ports.length; i++) {
    ports[i].postMessage({topic: topic, data: data});
  }
}
</code></pre>
                      <p>Every message has a data element with 2 fields; 'topic' and 'data'. The topic identifies which method or event is being used, and the data specifies additional data unique to the topic. All standardized methods and events have topics that begin with "social." - this means services are free to use topics without this prefix as a private implementation detail (for example, to communicate between some content from the service and the service's worker)</p>

                      <p>Sent by the worker, to set the properties for the provider icon and user profile data used for the toolbar button. If the users portrait and userName are absent, the button UI will indicate a logged out state. When indicating logged out state, status icons set via <code>social.ambient-notification</code> will be removed.Â  A service that does not handle user login should send this message with values appropriate to the website, such as the site icon, home url and brand name.</p>

                      <p>Sent by the worker, to update or create an ambient notification icon. One is sent for each icon.

                      <p>Sent by the worker, to create and display a notification object. This requests that the browser notify the user of an immediately-relevant change in state. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/navigator.mozNotification">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/navigator.mozNotification</a> for more detail. When the user clicks on the notification, the <code>social.notification-action</code> message is sent to the worker. The title of the notification will always be the name of the provider.</p>
                      <p>NOTE: We want to augment the mozNotification object defined in the docs with an additional "type" field. Details TBD. NOTE: No way of allowing duration and no way exposed to "cancel" a notification (assumption is they are very short-lived). Is this OK?</p>

                      <p>Page Marks are a simple mechanism to share a url with a social provider.Â  Page Marks differs from Share in that the url is only sent to the provider.Â  This functionality can handle use cases such as Facebook Like, Google +1, Pocket, or other save-for-later features.Â  When enabled, and additional Mark button will appear at the end of the Social toolbarbutton in Firefox.Â  There is no UI associated with the button other than a change of the button image to reflect the current marked or unmarked state.</p>

                      <p>If a service defines a SidebarWidget, the browser will instantiate a content region with the SidebarWidget URL as the location on some browser windows. These regions will not be instantiated until the Worker has been fully loaded. The content in these regions has the additional API defined in the Service Content API reference, above.</p>
                      <p>Sidebars can be in a <em>visible</em> or <em>hidden</em> state.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>When visible, they will receive a vertical rectangle of screen space in which to render; this rectangle is stable across changes in tab focus and has an independent scrollbar from the scrollbar of tabbed browsing content.</li>
                        <li>When hidden, a sidebar is completely removed from the visual hierarchy. The user agent will continue to deliver messages to it, and the sidebar may pre-render its DOM for later display.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Sidebar windows will only be instantiated on browser windows that have a full tabbed-browsing interface; windows created with window.open that do not have these interface elements will not have a sidebar.</p>
                      <p>When a tab that is rendered directly by the browser without a location bar is selected, the sidebar will automatically be placed into the <em>hidden</em> state. When the user navigates away from that tab, the sidebar will be made <em>visible</em> again. These tabs include the Add-ons management page, about:permissions, etc.</p>
                      <p>The minimized/maximized/hidden state of the sidebar widget is will be consistent across all browser windows. The most-recently-set state is remembered and used for new windows, and is persisted across browser restarts.</p>

                      <p>As a user browses web sites Firefox can discover new social providers and offer installation of those providers. A social providers website would include a LINK tag in the header pointing to a manifest file to enable this form of discovery. If the user either has stored authentication credentials in the Firefox password manager, or if the user frequents the website, Firefox will show a notification bar allowing the user to install the service.</p>

                      <p>A provider can become activated by dispatching a custom event of "ActivateSocialFeature" on the document. The document's location is then checked against a built-in whitelist and if the location is found then the feature is activated for that provider.</p>
                      <p>We recommend that providers require their users to click a link or button to activate the feature so the user is aware of the new functionality.</p>

  var event = new CustomEvent("ActivateSocialFeature");
