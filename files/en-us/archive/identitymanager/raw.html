      <p><strong><span title="This API has not been standardized."><i class="icon-warning-sign"> </i></span> Non-standard</strong><br>
      This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.</p>

<p>The <strong><code>IdentityManager</code></strong> of the  <a href="/en-US/docs/Persona" title="BrowserID">BrowserID protocol</a> exposes the BrowserID API, via <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/id" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.id</code></a>. This API has gone through several significant revisions. Each generation is listed separately below.</p>

<h2 id="ObserverMethods" name="ObserverMethods">The "Observer" API (Current)</h2>

<p>The Observer API introduces much-requested features, such as an improved post-verification experience for first-time users, automatic persistent logins, and easier integration with native applications.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdentityManager/watch" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>IdentityManager.watch()</code></a></dt>
 <dd>Registers callbacks to be invoked when a user logs into or out of a website.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdentityManager/request" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>IdentityManager.request()</code></a></dt>
 <dd>Requests a signed identity assertion from the user.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdentityManager/logout" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>IdentityManager.logout()</code></a></dt>
 <dd>Logs the user out of a website and prevents the <code>onlogin</code> action from automatically firing on their next visit.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note">
<p>Users with third-party cookies disabled may experience problems logging in using the Observer API as detailed in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues/2999" title="https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues/2999">issue 2999</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="CallbackMethods" name="CallbackMethods">The "Callback" API (Current)</h2>

<p>The Callback API was introduced in November 2011. It improved upon the initial API by allowing options to be passed to <code>navigator.id.get()</code> and offering experimental support for BrowserID-managed persistent sessions.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdentityManager/get" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>IdentityManager.get()</code></a></dt>
 <dd>Gets the user's BrowserID in a signed assertion.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="VerifiedEmailMethods" name="VerifiedEmailMethods">The "VerifiedEmail" API (Deprecated)</h2>

<p>The VerifiedEmail API was BrowserID's first API. It was deprecated at the end of 2011.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdentityManager/getVerifiedEmail" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>IdentityManager.getVerifiedEmail()</code></a> <span title="This deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work."><i class="icon-thumbs-down-alt"> </i></span></dt>
 <dd>Gets the user's BrowserID in a signed assertion. This method is deprecated; <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/id/get" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.id.get()</code></a> is backwards compatible and can be used instead.</dd>
