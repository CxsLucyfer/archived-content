<p><span class="comment">** Notes ** - The Solution Quick Reference needs more attention. - I'm also looking for a way to organize all that information. - Some inline examples were removed because of technical limitations. They are actually replaced by ''-(EXAMPLE REMOVED)-''</span> The goal of this handbook is to help you update websites to work with standards-based browsers and properly detect <a href="en/Gecko">Gecko</a>.</p>

<p>If you're new to standards, you may find <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/upgrade_2.html">Using Web Standards in Your Web Pages</a> a helpful introduction.</p>

<p>Gecko is an embeddable browser, developed as part of the <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> open source project and based on <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/">W3 Standards</a> rather than the proprietary approaches of the past. Adhering to web standards simplifies cross-browser web development and enables <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/">accessibility</a>.</p>

<h3 id="4.x_vs._Gecko" name="4.x_vs._Gecko">4.x vs. Gecko</h3>

<p>Since 1997, much of the Web's content has been developed for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 or Netscape Navigator 4. These browsers were developed before the relevant <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> recommendations for <a href="en/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="en/CSS">CSS</a>, and the <a href="en/DOM">DOM</a> existed.</p>

<p>These earlier, non-standards based browsers differed in several ways from Gecko:</p>

<ul>
 <li>These browsers use proprietary (non-standard) <a href="en/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="en/CSS">CSS</a>, and <a href="en/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.</li>
 <li>Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape Navigator 4 share support for a large part of the HTML 3.2 standard and basic JavaScript.</li>
 <li>While they support the CSS 1 standard to some degree, the implementations are not complete and have non-standard features added.</li>
 <li>Neither Internet Explorer 4 or Netscape Navigator 4 support the W3 <a href="en/DOM">DOM</a>. Instead, each browser supports its own proprietary API for manipulating the content, style and position of HTML Elements in a web page.</li>
 <li>In addition, Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape Navigator 4 use completely different methods of embedding third-party software into the browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gecko is a cross-platform browser engine, compatible with a number of Windows versions including Windows XP, as well as Mac and Linux. Because of Gecko's cross-platform nature, functionality is generally very much the same on different platforms unlike Internet Explorer for Mac and IE for Windows, which are very different programs and so may behave quite differently from each other.</p>

<h3 id="Quick_Compatibility_Test" name="Quick_Compatibility_Test">Quick Compatibility Test</h3>

<p>If your site uses Netscape 4.x and Microsoft proprietary technologies, see <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/upgrade_2.html">Using Web Standards in Your Web Pages</a> for a quick tutorial on standards. This compatibility test will be most beneficial to sites using simple code or that have updated to support standards.</p>

<h4 id="Set_Up_Browsers_For_Testing" name="Set_Up_Browsers_For_Testing">Set Up Browsers For Testing</h4>

<p>The various Gecko-based browsers do not always contain Netscape in the user-agent string. Thus it's critical to verify that you are properly detecting browsers such as AOL for macOS.</p>

<p>You can either <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/download.html">download</a> the various browsers. Or, if you are using user-agent detection, you can install an extension in Firefox or Mozilla which allows you to "spoof" the user-agent strings of the various Gecko browsers. Here's how:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Launch <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla</a> or <a class="external" href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>. The benefit of using these browsers is that if you're only detecting Netscape or Netscape6 you'll see the issues right away.</li>
 <li>Install the <a class="link-https" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=59">User Agent Switcher extension</a>.</li>
 <li>After restarting your browser, add the the <a href="en/Gecko_User_Agent_Strings">user-agent strings</a> that you want to test to the list (Tools | User Agent Switcher | Options | Options... | User Agents | Add...). Once you filled the dialog box (it should look like the screenshot below), click OK and close the<em>Options</em> dialog.<br>
  Â </li>
 <li>You can now start using the user-agent string you've just created by clicking Tools | User Agent Switcher |<em>The name you have chosen</em>. You can verify the string got changed by looking under Help | About.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find the <a href="en/Gecko_User_Agent_Strings">user agent strings</a> of many Gecko-based browsers <a href="en/Gecko_User_Agent_Strings">here</a>. If possible, also download the actual clients (<a class="external" href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a>, <a class="external" href="http://www.aol.com">AOL</a>, <a class="external" href="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</a>) for testing.</p>

<p>The following scenarios all relate to browser detection. For more solutions to common problems please continue reading this handbook.</p>

<h5 id="Problem:_Site_supports_standards_but_does_not_look_right" name="Problem:_Site_supports_standards_but_does_not_look_right">Problem: Site supports standards but does not look right</h5>

<p>Try picking the Internet Explorer 6 user-agent string. If this works, set up your detection to serve IE 6 content to visitors with Gecko in their user-agent strings. IE 6.x is actually more similar to Gecko browsers than Netscape 4.x is to Gecko, due to increased support of W3C standards.</p>

<h5 id="Problem:_Site_certified_on_Netscape_6.x_looks_incorrect_in_other_browsers" name="Problem:_Site_certified_on_Netscape_6.x_looks_incorrect_in_other_browsers">Problem: Site certified on Netscape 6.x looks incorrect in other browsers</h5>

<p>If your site is already Gecko-compatible, try switching back to a Netscape 6 user-agent string. If it looks OK, you're probably detecting only Netscape or Netscape6. Detecting Gecko instead is the easy way to fix this as well as accomodate users of Mozilla, CompuServe 7, etc. (<a href="en/Browser_Detection_and_Cross_Browser_Support">Related article</a>)</p>

<h3 id="AOL_or_CompuServe_Problems" name="AOL_or_CompuServe_Problems">AOL or CompuServe Problems</h3>

<p>Even if your site works on Netscape 7.x, it is important to test your site in <a class="external" href="http://www.aol.com/">AOL for macOS</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe 7</a> to check for <a href="en/Browser_Detection_and_Cross_Browser_Support">browser detection</a> and network issues.</p>

<h4 id="Testing_AOL_From_Within_a_Firewall" name="Testing_AOL_From_Within_a_Firewall">Testing AOL From Within a Firewall</h4>

<p>If you need to connect to AOL via a corporate firewall, America Online has registered TCP/IP ports 5190 and 11523 so you can communicate with the AOL client software. This way you can test your site on the AOL client from behind your firewall, provided that your network administrators will open these ports.</p>

<p>You need to be connected to the Internet to test your site on AOL; it isn't possible to access your site on a local machine via your LAN, without an Internet connection. See <a class="external" href="http://webmaster.aol.com/">Webmaster@AOL</a> for further information.</p>

<p>As discussed in Mozilla's <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/upgrade_2.html">Using Web Standards in Your Web Pages</a>, coding for cross-browser compatibility requires you write standard markup that Gecko-based browsers, Netscape 4, and IE browsers can render properly.</p>

<h3 id="Common_Coding_and_Server_Problems" name="Common_Coding_and_Server_Problems">Common Coding and Server Problems</h3>

<p>This section details solutions to the most common problems affecting standards-based browsers as well as issues that may specifically affect Gecko browsers.</p>

<h4 id="Proprietary_HTML" name="Proprietary_HTML">Proprietary HTML</h4>

<p><strong>Problem: Using Browser-Specific Proprietary HTML Markup (such as &lt;LAYER&gt;).</strong></p>

<p>Since a browser is supposed to ignore HTML tags it does not recognize and render the content inside the tags, web page authors have used the technique of combining proprietary HTML that will work as expected in each browser.</p>

<p>Gecko browsers will ignore both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator 4 proprietary HTML tags. So, a page may not display in Gecko browsers as it does in Internet Explorer 4 or in Netscape Navigator 4.</p>

<p>The prime example of this is the use of Netscape Navigator 4 proprietary &lt;LAYER&gt;, commonly used in site navigation. For standards-based alternatives, see <a href="en/Updating_DHTML_Web_Pages_for_Next_Generation_Browsers">Updating DHTML Web Pages for Next Generation Browsers</a>.</p>

<p>An HTML page can be quickly checked for the use of proprietary HTML Markup by submitting the page to the <a class="external" href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3's HTML Validator</a> using the HTML 4.01 DOCTYPE. We will have more to say about DOCTYPEs later in this article, but essentially the DOCTYPE is supposed to indicate to a browser what version of HTML is used in the page.</p>

<p>The <a href="en/HTML_Element_Cross_Reference">HTML Element Cross Reference</a> provides a list of all HTML Elements supported in Netscape 4, Gecko browsers, Internet Explorer 4 and up and can be used to determine which HTML Elements are supported by all browsers.</p>

<h4 id="Browser_Detection" name="Browser_Detection">Browser Detection</h4>

<p><strong>Problem: Faulty Browser Detection or Sniffing </strong></p>

<p>While browser detection is useful in enabling authors to code pages that work only in specific browsers, improper browser detection can lead to major user experience breakages.</p>

<p>Many problems can occur when a web page uses browser detection to determine which proprietary features to use for a particular browser.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="en/Browser_Detection_and_Cross_Browser_Support">Browser Detection and Cross Browser Support</a> article for a better approach to detecting browsers.</p>

<h4 id="Browser-specific_Workarounds" name="Browser-specific_Workarounds">Browser-specific Workarounds</h4>

<p><strong>Problem: Code includes workarounds for bugs and browser-specific quirks. </strong></p>

<p>Since a Web page is judged not by how well it is written but by how well it displays in a browser, authors have developed many techniques which take advantage of idiosyncracies in particular browsers to achieve the desired effect. This is of particular importance since the early implementations of CSS found in Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape Navigator 4 had many bugs. In order to achieve the desired effects on a page, authors wrote HTML and JavaScript which depended upon these bugs in order to work properly.</p>

<p>This can cause problems in Gecko browsers since it implements the standards strictly. The old "code to the bugs" approach will not work for Netscape 6.x, Netscape 7.x and other Mozilla based browsers.</p>

<h5 id="Example_-_Putting_forms_in_Tables" name="Example_-_Putting_forms_in_Tables">Example - Putting forms in Tables</h5>

<p><strong>Invalid HTML</strong> to eliminate line break in &lt;FORM&gt;.</p>

<p>In older browsers, this results in the TD cell tightly wrapping around the input element.</p>

<pre>&lt;table border="1"&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;form name="form2"&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;input type="text"&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;table&gt;</pre>

<p>This approach is commonly used to get around the fact that &lt;FORM&gt; is a block level element in HTML and will naturally begin on a new line in the page. Unfortunately, this is invalid HTML and can cause problems both when parsing the page and when applying the CSS styles.</p>

<h5 id="Incorrect_Use_of_XML_Empty_Tag_notation" name="Incorrect_Use_of_XML_Empty_Tag_notation">Incorrect Use of XML Empty Tag notation</h5>

<p>Many authors have taken to using XML Empty tag notation (&lt;tag /&gt;) in their HTML files. In XML, an Empty tag <strong>never</strong> has any content. The XHTML backward compatibility guidelines state that <strong>Empty</strong> Elements can be coded by following the tag name with a space followed with as slash as in &lt;tag /&gt;. To be backwardly compatible you <strong>must</strong> have a space before the trailing /&gt;. In addition, you must only use the XML Empty tag notation for HTML Elements that are always Empty - and not for HTML Elements that have optional ending tags.</p>

<p>For example, it is ok to code &lt;br&gt; as &lt;br /&gt; although there is no benefit to do so in HTML documents. But it is <strong>not</strong> OK to code &lt;option&gt; as &lt;option /&gt;. To understand why, consider the following:</p>

<table class="standard-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <th>HTML without optional ending tags</th>
   <th>Equivalent HTML with optional ending tags</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <pre>
&lt;select&gt;
&lt;option&gt;OptionValue
&lt;/select&gt;</pre>
   </td>
   <td>
    <pre>
&lt;select&gt;
&lt;option&gt;OptionValue&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;</pre>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now consider if we used the XML Empty tag notation: the &lt;option /&gt;.</p>

<table class="standard-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <th>HTML with XML Empty Tag notation</th>
   <th>Equivalent HTML with ending tags</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <pre>
&lt;select&gt;
&lt;option /&gt;OptionValue
&lt;/select&gt;</pre>
   </td>
   <td>
    <pre>
&lt;select&gt;
&lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt;OptionValue
&lt;/select&gt;</pre>
   </td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is simply not correct. If you must use the XML Empty tag notation, then only do so for HTML Elements that never have any content - <strong>not</strong> for HTML Elements that have optional ending tags.</p>

<h5 id="CSS_ID.27s_should_be_case-sensitive" name="CSS_ID.27s_should_be_case-sensitive">CSS ID's should be case-sensitive</h5>

<p>Gecko implements the case sensitivity of Class ID's correctly and will display this example correctly. However Internet Explorer treats all CSS ID's as case-insensitive and will not display this example correctly.</p>

<pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  #id1 { text-decoration: line-through; }
  #ID1 { text-decoration: underline; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div id="id1"&gt;
  should be line-through
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ID1"&gt;
  should be underline
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>-(EXAMPLE REMOVED)-</p>

<p>Note that the <a class="external" href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C's HTML Validator</a> will flag HTML ID attributes as duplicates if they only differ due to case. There appears to be some inconsistency between the actual HTML 4.01 Recommendation and the SGML declaration for HTML on whether ID attributes are case sensitive or not. This is unfortunate since the <a class="external" href="http://validator.w3.org/">HTML Validator</a> is one of the primary vehicles web developers have for learning about the standards.</p>

<p>Due to the common nature of this error, Netscape 6.2 began treating CSS ID attributes as case-insensitive in <strong>Quirks mode only</strong>. If you are invoking Standards mode, you should still code your CSS to be consistent with respect to case.</p>

<h5 id="CSS_Class_names_should_be_case-sensitive" name="CSS_Class_names_should_be_case-sensitive">CSS Class names should be case-sensitive</h5>

<pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  .class1 { font-size: 1em; }
  .CLASS1 { font-size: 2em; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class="class1"&gt;
  should be font-size: 1em;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="CLASS1"&gt;
  should be font-size: 2em;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>-(EXAMPLE REMOVED)-</p>

<p>Gecko implements the case sensitivity of Class names correctly and will display this example correctly while Internet Explorer treats all CSS Classnames's as case-insensitive and will not display this example correctly.</p>

<p>Due to the common nature of this error by web authors, Netscape 6.2 began treating CSS Class attributes as case-insensitive in <strong>Quirks mode only</strong>. If you are invoking Standards mode, you should still code your CSS to be consistent with respect to case.</p>

<h5 id="Incorrect_Relative_URLs" name="Incorrect_Relative_URLs">Incorrect Relative URLs</h5>

<p>A Relative URL is one which refers to the same web server where a web page is hosted. A Relative URL that refers to a path relative to the directory where a Web page is located looks like path/file.html. Relative URLs that refer to a path relative to the web server's root directory look like /path/file.html.</p>

<p>Older browsers supported the invalid use of <span class="nowiki">http://path/</span> for URLs relative to a web server's root directory but Gecko browsers do not. To correctly specify a web page relative to a web server's root directory, use URLs of the form /path/file.html.</p>

<h5 id="Invalid_use_of_spaces_in_name_Attributes_.28such_as_image_maps.29" name="Invalid_use_of_spaces_in_name_Attributes_.28such_as_image_maps.29">Invalid use of spaces in name Attributes (such as image maps)</h5>

<p>Many authors seem to be infected by a penchant to use spaces in names. A <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2">name or id</a> attribute in HTML 4.01 may not legally contain spaces. This can cause problems with Gecko-based browsers, especially in image maps. You should make sure that your name attributes are coded using valid characters only.</p>

<h4 id="Bad_Code_Due_to_Old_APIS_and_Tools" name="Bad_Code_Due_to_Old_APIS_and_Tools">Bad Code Due to Old APIS and Tools</h4>

<p><strong>Problem: Obsolete APIs or web authoring tools generate non-standard code.</strong></p>

<p>Many older versions of cross-browser APIs in common use around the web such as <a class="external" href="http://dynapi.sourceforge.net/">DYNAPI</a> do not support Gecko for one or more of the reasons listed above. This is also the case for older versions of web authoring tools such as Macromedia's Dreamweaver 2 and 3.</p>

<p>Newer versions of these APIs and tools do support Gecko however. For example, <a class="external" href="http://dynapi.sourceforge.net/">DYNAPI</a> is now maintained at SourceForge and offers a Gecko-compatible version. Newer versions of <a href="en/Standards-Compliant_Authoring_Tools">web authoring tools</a> support Gecko.</p>

<h4 id="Wrong_DOCTYPE" name="Wrong_DOCTYPE">Wrong DOCTYPE</h4>

<p><strong>Problem: An incorrect DOCTYPE can completely alter a page's presentation. </strong></p>

<p>Gecko, Internet Explorer for Mac OS and Internet Explorer 6 all use a technique called DOCTYPE sniffing to determine if a page is to be laid out in a fashion compatible with the older browsers or if it is to be laid out in a fashion compatible with the W3 standards.</p>

<p>Using the appropriate DOCTYPE in an HTML document allows a web page author to continue to support the older, less compliant browsers while also supporting the newer, more compliant browsers by specifiying special Quirks mode layout via the DOCTYPE. As time progresses and the older browsers drop in market share, web page authors can transition to standards-based layout by using the appropriate DOCTYPE. (<a href="en/Liberty!_Equality!_Validity!">related article</a>)</p>

<p>While DOCTYPE sniffing is a useful means of continuing to support the older browsers, it can be a problem for newer browsers such as Netscape 6.x and Netscape 7.x if an inappropriate layout mode is specified.</p>

<p>Gecko has two layout modes: Quirks and Standard. Quirks mode mimics the behavior of Netscape Navigator 4 while Standards mode follows the W3C Recommendations for HTML and CSS. In particular, Standards Layout Mode uses the CSS Box Model as defined in <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visudet.html">Chapter 10</a> of the CSS 2 Recommendation. The mode is picked based on the DOCTYPE declaration (or the lack thereof) at the beginning of an HTML document.</p>

<h4 id="Invalid_Comments" name="Invalid_Comments">Invalid Comments</h4>

<p>Gecko also has three parsing modes: Quirks, <a href="en/Gecko's_Almost_Standards_Mode">Almost Standards</a>, and Standards. Quirks mode allows the use of invalid comments containing two dashes -- while Standards and Almost Standards modes do not.</p>

<p>You'll find for that some plugins behave differently in Gecko than in Netscape Navigator 4. Visit the <a href="en/Plugins">Plugins</a> page to learn about scripting Gecko browsers, proper use of tags, changes in the plugin architecture vs. the Netscape 4 generation, and suggested plugin strategies.</p>

<h4 id="Incorrectly_specified_MIME_types" name="Incorrectly_specified_MIME_types">Incorrectly specified MIME types</h4>

<p>Many Web servers have incorrectly specified MIME types for files. Gecko browsers require that the server specifies the correct MIME type to match the content type:</p>

<ul>
 <li>HTML - text/html</li>
 <li>CSS - text/css (<a href="en/Incorrect_MIME_Type_for_CSS_Files">related article</a>)</li>
 <li>XML - text/xml</li>
 <li>SVG - image/svg+xml</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Faulty_implementations_of_HTTP" name="Faulty_implementations_of_HTTP">Faulty implementations of HTTP</h4>

<p>Several Web Servers incorrectly implement the HTTP protocol which can result in problems for Netscape 6.</p>

<h4 id="Faulty_implementations_of_SSL" name="Faulty_implementations_of_SSL">Faulty implementations of SSL</h4>

<p>Older browser such as Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape Navigator 4 implemented older versions of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. The most common version of SSL on the web today is SSL 3.0, however the newest version TLS (SSL 3.1), which is supported by Gecko browsers is not supported by many Web Servers today. Unfortunately, several implementations of SSL 3.0 incorrectly implement the negotiation of which version of SSL to use and fail to connect to Gecko browsers.</p>

<p>For more detail on this issue, please read <a href="en/Notes_on_TLS_-_SSL_3.0_Intolerant_Servers">Notes on TLS - SSL 3.0 Intolerant Servers</a>.</p>
