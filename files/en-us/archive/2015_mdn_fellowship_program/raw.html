<h2 id="2015_MDN_Fellowship_Program">2015 MDN Fellowship Program</h2>

<p>Launching in Q1 2015, the Mozilla Developer Fellowship intends to accelerate the involvement of highly-skilled and experienced web developers with the open web.</p>

<h3 id="Who">Who</h3>

<p>Web and mobile developers with an established track record of contributions and expertise in a specific web technology, function or domain who wish to increase the effectiveness of their teaching and communications.</p>

<h3 id="What">What</h3>

<p>Seven weeks of partnering closely with Mozilla to (1) build curriculum, code, or likely both; and (2) receive coaching, training and best practices for effectively communicating and educating with technical information. We expect this to be between 5-10 hours of your time per week.</p>

<p>Specific projects (we encourage you to target one of these in your application):</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Brief project description</dt>
 <dd>Mozilla participates in an important W3C open testing initiative, TestTheWebForward.com. To support our efforts, the Fellow will review various technical specifications to identify gaps between the documentation and current situation and refine existing tests to adapt to this cross-browser test harness.</dd>
 <dt>Activities and Deliverables</dt>
 <dd>Identify gaps between existing documentation and current development environments. The work would entail refining existing tests to adapt to this framework.</dd>
 <dt>Required skills and experience</dt>
 <dd>Experience and comfort writing Javascript test scripts.</dd>

<h4 id="Service_Workers">Service Workers</h4>

<dl>
 <dt>Brief Project Description</dt>
 <dd>Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser and (when available) the network. They enable the creation of effective offline experiences and wiill also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.</dd>
 <dt>Activities and Deliverables</dt>
 <dd>Write a demonstration web application (new or existing) to showcase Service Worker functionality. Provide detailed API descriptions.</dd>
 <dt>Required skills and experience</dt>
 <dd>Experienced Web developer with expertise in JavaScript, CSS, HTML as well as with efficient network interaction (queuing resource fetching, etc.). Self-starter and autonomous worker</dd>

<dl>
 <dt>Brief Project Description</dt>
 <dd>WebGL is the latest incarnation of the OpenGL family of real time rendering immediate mode graphics APIs. WebGL is getting some cool new features in 2015 with the standardization efforts around the WebGL 2.0 spec being published.</dd>
 <dt>Activities and Deliverables</dt>
 <dd>Help us develop a curriculum on MDN for teaching developers new to graphics programming the WebGL APIs.</dd>
 <dt>Required skills and experience</dt>
 <dd>Computer graphics experience with programmable shaders and the OpenGL, OpenGL ES, WebGL, or Direct3D APIs. Command of JavaScript and module systems preferred.</dd>

<h4 id="Web_App_Performance">Web App Performance</h4>

<dl>
 <dt>Brief Project Description</dt>
 <dd>Web performance is a feature that needs to be considered from serving content to rendering to interactivity. Finding and addressing performance bottlenecks depends on tooling the browser networking and rendering but also, often more important, user perception.</dd>
 <dt>Activities and Deliverables</dt>
 <dd>Help us develop a curriculum on MDN for teaching developers to master performance tooling and to develop web apps with performance as a feature.</dd>
 <dt>Required skills and experience</dt>
 <dd>Experienced Web developer with expertise in JavaScript, CSS, HTML. Knowledge of server-side development, caching and network layers preferred.</dd>

<p>Mozilla will provide coaching, direction and training on teaching best practices. Subject to Mozilla’s travel reimbursement policies, Mozilla will cover Fellows travel, room, per diem food costs and visa costs up to $3,000 to attend the Orientation. Fellows are responsible for obtaining their own visas if any are required (Mozilla will provide reasonable supporting documentation).</p>

<p>The Fellows will meet the stated deliverables of their projects and meet weekly with their mentor, the program lead and their other Fellows. The Fellow will also share the results of their projects at 1-2 events agreed upon by the Fellow and the Program Director, as well as on their personal channels (blog, social media, etc). The Fellow is responsible for any related visas (Mozilla can provide any necessary supporting documentation). Fellows will be required to sign Mozilla’s Fellowship agreement in order to participate.</p>
