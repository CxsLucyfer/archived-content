 <p><strong>Important</strong>: This information is out of date; for up-to-date information on using these design patterns, as implemented in Firefox OS building blocks, go to our <a href="/en-US/Apps/Design/Firefox_OS_building_blocks">Firefox OS building blocks</a> page.</p>
</div>
<p>Multi-select mode is used to let the user perform &quot;bulk actions;&quot; that is, to select a number of items and then act on all of them at once. This may be something like deleting six emails from the user&apos;s inbox or choosing two photos to email to a friend. Multi-select mode actually encompasses two similar but functionally different modes: <strong>multi-select mode</strong>, for choosing multiple items and performing actions on them; and <strong>edit mode</strong>, which lets the user change existing data in the list (such as editing data in a table) and then save or discard the changes.</p>
<p>Either way, this mode is always used on lists of itemsâ€”either a vertical list (such as a list of email messages) or a grid (such as a grid of photos in a photo gallery app). See the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Patterns/Multi_select/Coding" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Patterns/Multi_select/Coding">Coding guide</a> for details on how to implement this user interface pattern.</p>
<h2 id="Characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
 <li>It&apos;s important to note that this is a <strong>mode</strong>, not a context switch. Animation and visual design should give the user the impression that they&apos;re in a temporary mode within the original view, not in a new view.</li>
 <li>Multi-select mode may also be known as &quot;edit mode&quot; or &quot;select mode&quot; depending on the use case.</li>
 <li>The header text should indicate the action the user is preparing to take, such as &quot;Select photos&quot; or &quot;Select messages.&quot; When an item is selected, the header should be changed to indicate how many messages have been selected.</li>
 <li>The view should exit multi select mode when the user either selects a button that performs an action (such as a &quot;Delete&quot; button) or taps a cancel button.</li>
 <li>If the user has taken action (such as deleting three message threads), a <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks/Status">status bar</a> should appear to confirm the action.</li>
</ul>
