<p>An entry sheet is used to edit a single setting or option in your app that either contains a large number of possible values (such as a text entry form or a long list of choices) <strong>or</strong> requires multiple inputs or selections, such as configuring and connecting to a WiFi network.</p>
<h2 id="Characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Occupies the entire screen.</li>
 <li>The user should be given the impression that they're on the same page as whatever user interface element that caused the entry sheet to open; the entry sheet should be perceived as a temporary modal overlay. The user hasn't navigated deeper into a hierarchy of interface pages. To reinforce this impression:
  <ul>
   <li>Valid animations when opening an entry sheet include things like sliding in from the top or bottom, a cross-fade, scaling in, and the like.</li>
   <li>"Cancel" buttons should be used instead of "Back" buttons.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Every element in the entry sheet must be related to adjusting a single setting, and there should not be links to other pages, lists, or dialog boxes.</li>
 <li>The user will typically have two options to close an entry sheet: a Cancel button, and a button that accepts the user's data (this may be labeled "Done", "Send", "Join", or the like—it should be a verb describing what action will occur when the sheet is closed).</li>
</ul>
