<div class="summary">
 <p>The app validator is a tool built to test that apps are ready for submission to the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace">Firefox Marketplace</a> and are suitable for running on a variety of platforms. Apps submitted to the Marketplace are automatically run through the validator, which represents the first step of the review process.</p>
</div>
<p>Some checks that the validator performs include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Ensuring the <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/Manifest">app manifest</a> is formatted correctly with appropriate values.</li>
 <li>Ensuring resources linked to in the manifest exist and are properly formatted. For instance, the <code>launch_path</code> is tested to exist, and icons are tested to be a valid image of the listed size.</li>
 <li>Ensuring the app does not request <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/App_permissions">permissions</a> that it cannot use.</li>
 <li>Testing that at least one locale provided in the manifest is a locale supported by the Firefox Marketplace.</li>
 <li>Testing that no <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError">JavaScript syntax errors</a> exist.</li>
 <li>Checking for garbage files and file types (e.g.: EXE, DLL, etc.) that are banned in <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/Packaged_apps">packaged apps</a>.</li>
 <li>Testing for appcache support in <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Publish_options#Hosted_apps">hosted apps</a>.</li>
 <li>Checking that packages do not contain version control.</li>
 <li>Identifying potential <a href="/en-US/Apps/CSP">CSP</a> violations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Using_the_App_Validator">Using the App Validator</h2>
<p>There are a couple of different ways to use the App Validator; this section details them both.</p>
<h3 id="Online">Online</h3>
<p>The validator is available to Marketplace developers in the Marketplace <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/validator">Developer Hub</a>. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">On this page, you'll be presented with the option to validate a hosted app by providing the URL of the app's manifest, or validating a packaged app by uploading a zip file.</span></p>
<h3 id="On_Your_Own_Computer"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">On Your Own Computer</span></h3>
<p>The source code and setup documentation can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/app-validator">app-validator Github page</a>. You can install the validator on your own computer and run it without needing to access the Firefox Marketplace.</p>
<p>After following the setup instructions, you can use the validator by running the <code>app-validator</code> script in the root:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash"><code>app-validator ~/src/path/to/my/manifest.webapp -v</code></pre>
<p>The first argument should be the path to your manifest, the path to a ZIP file (for packaged apps) or a URL pointing at your manifest online. The <code>-v</code> argument outputs a verbose summary of each error, warning, and notice that the validator generates.</p>
<p>A full description of the arguments that the validator accepts and the forms of output that it can produce are <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/app-validator#running">available on Github</a>.</p>
