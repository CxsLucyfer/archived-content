  <a href="/en-US/docs/CSS/CSS_transitions">CSS transitions</a></dt>
 <dd>
  CSS transitions let you animate changes to your CSS. Once a transition effect is configured, changes to your CSS occur over a period of time instead of instantaneously. This makes it possible to easily and efficiently create a wide variety of visual effects in your apps.</dd>

  <a href="/en-US/docs/CSS/CSS_animations">CSS animations</a></dt>
 <dd>
  CSS animations let you animate changes to your document on a more fundamental level, using keyframes to precisely configure the animation effect. This also lets you create looping animation effects rather than effects that happen just once, as is the case with transitions, all without relying on JavaScript.</dd>

  <a href="/en-US/docs/SVG">SVG</a></dt>
 <dd>
  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a technology that lets you draw graphics using vectors instead of bitmapped images. This is great for scalability, presenting diagrams and charts, and for high-quality, scalable user interfaces.</dd>
