 <p>This article provides a summary of the different JavaScript libraries and frameworks you might choose to work with when developing an open web app, along with tips, tricks, and gotchas to be aware of.</p>

<h2 id="AngularJS">AngularJS</h2>
<h3 id="Whitelist_app_protocol_with_AngularJS">Whitelist "app:/" protocol with AngularJS</h3>
<p>If you have developed a packaged app with AngularJS, you may run into this error message:</p>
<pre>The address wasn't understood
Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (unsafe) isn't associated with any program. </pre>
<p>When you use Angular data binding to generate a URL, Angular will match the URL against its whitelist. If the URL does not match, Angular prefixes the url with "unsafe:" (<a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$compileProvider">see the Angular documentation</a>). To make you app work with AngularJS, you can add "app:/"--the protocol FirefoxOS packaged apps use--to Angular's whitelist. In your app's configuration, this is how to whitelist "app:/":</p>
<pre>var app = angular.module( 'myApp', [] ).config(['$compileProvider', function($compileProvider) {
        $compileProvider.<b>url</b>SanitizationWhitelist(/^\s*(https?|ftp|mailto|app):/);
    }
]);
</pre>
<p>Or in AngularJS 1.1+</p>
<pre>var app = angular.module( 'myApp', [] ).config(['$compileProvider', function($compileProvider) {
        $compileProvider.<b>aHref</b>SanitizationWhitelist(/^\s*(https?|ftp|mailto|app):/);
    }
]);
</pre>
