<h2 id="Animation_and_Graphics">Animation and Graphics</h2>

<p><span class="seoSummary">There are various tools found all around the web for creating animations and graphics for your work. In this article, we will go over a few of these options so that you can use to make your project stand out! For example, CSS is one way to apply animations to HTML elements, while Chartist is a great tool for creating graphs and charts.</span></p>

<h3 id="Animation" style="line-height: 24px; font-size: 1.71428571428571rem;">Animation</h3>

<p>There are many ways to animate things on the Web: CSS, SVG, canvas, WebGL, JavaScript, etc. Using CSS is a great way to apply simple animations to your HTML elements. <a href="http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.css</a> is a guide that shows how to apply fades, bounces, flips, zooms and more to your content.</p>

<p>For more complex animations, we recommend checking out <a href="http://julian.com/research/velocity/">Velocity.js</a>. Velocity features color animation, transforms, loops, easings, SVG support, scrolling and more in a tiny library (9k) that also works across most browsers.</p>

<h4 id="Charts_and_Graphs">Charts and Graphs</h4>

<p>There are many chart and graphing libraries on the web, many of which work well on FirefoxOS. If you are looking for a recommendation, check out <a href="http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/">Chartist</a>. Chartist charts and graphs use SVG, are responsive and DPI independent, and provide a clear separation between styling and definition/control.</p>

<p>To use Chartist in your app, go to the root folder of your app in your terminal and type:</p>

<pre>bower install chartist --save</pre>

<p id="sect1">Read the <a href="http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/getting-started.html">Chartist - Getting Started</a> guide for documentation on building with Chartist.</p>

<h4 id="2D_Content">2D Content</h4>

<p>&lt;canvas&gt; is a HTML element which can be used to draw graphics using scripting (usually JavaScript). Beyond simple 2D drawing, the canvas element can be used to composite photos, provide animations and a host of other applications. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial">MDN Canvas Tutorial</a> covers this subject in-depth.</p>

<p>2D Drawing can also be performed using WebGL. For fast 2D graphics, we recommend checking out <a href="http://www.pixijs.com/">Pixi.js</a>. It renders 2D content using WebGL, but can also fall back to using canvas based on browser support.</p>

<h4 id="3D_Content">3D Content</h4>

<p>3D Content can be rendered in most modern browsers using WebGL. MDN provides an excellent <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebGL/Getting_started_with_WebGL">Getting Started with WebGL guide</a>. If you're looking for a library that simplifies the creation of 3D scenes and content and has a large community, we recommend checking out <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>.</p>
