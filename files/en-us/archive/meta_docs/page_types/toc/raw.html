<p>An index or table of contents page provides a list of related articles. These may be one of two types: a table of contents for a virtual "book" such as the <a href="/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide" title="/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide">JavaScript Guide</a>, or a list of API terms, such as the <a href="/en-US/docs/CSS/CSS_Reference" title="/en-US/docs/CSS/CSS_Reference">CSS Reference</a>. The layout of each of these is the same, but the body content looks different. Let's start with the overall page layout.</p>
<h2 id="Page_layout">Page layout</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5223/IndexTOCPage.png" style="width: 700px; height: 703px;"></p>
<h3 id="Summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The page begins with a brief summary of the document suite for which this is an index or table of contents.</p>
<h3 id="Index_or_TOC">Index or TOC</h3>
<p>Then comes a section entitled either "Index" or "Table of Contents". The contents of this section are as follows:</p>
<h4 id="Index">Index</h4>
<p>For an index, this is a multi-column area divided up by letter of the alphabet, with items for each page in the suite. For an example, see the <a href="/en-US/docs/CSS/CSS_Reference" title="/en-US/docs/CSS/CSS_Reference">CSS Reference</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Table_of_contents">Table of contents</h4>
<p>A table of contents is a simple <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol" title="The HTML &lt;ol> element represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered list."><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code></a> (ordered list) of the chapters and, optionally, one or two heading levels deep, of the documents comprising the "book." For example:</p>
<p>1. Introduction to JavaScript (an article at en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Intro)<br>
  2. JavaScript terminology (top of an article at en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Terminology)<br>
  2.1 Object (the section "Object" in the article en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Terminology)</p>
<p>(etc)</p>
<h3 id="Related_topics">Related topics</h3>
<p>A multi-column (when possible) list of other content related to this documentation. For the JavaScript Guide, this list might include the JavaScript Reference, the SpiderMonkey landing page, etc.</p>
<h3 id="Recent_changes">Recent changes</h3>
<p>The recent changes list is a list of changes to articles in this set of content that have changed recently. For example, on the CSS Reference index page, this would be a list of recent changes to articles in that reference.</p>
<h2 id="Editing">Editing</h2>
<p>This section describes details of the editing experience for TOC/index pages.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> We will <em>probably</em> want to establish a privilege group for editing of landing pages. In fact, probably two groups: one group that has privileges for editing any landing page, and then another group with per-landing page privileges, to allow configuration of people with special permission to edit given zones' landing pages. This will let us give product managers for given topic areas permission to edit their topic's landing pages.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="Editing_notes">Editing notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There is nothing on the sidebar(s) on landing pages that the user needs to be able to edit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Editing_features_needed">Editing features needed</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Add "Related topics" box</dt>
  <dd>
    This button would create the "Related topics" box at the bottom of the page. Only one such box is allowed per page.</dd>
  <dt>
    "Link to all subpages" button</dt>
  <dd>
    This button would insert appropriate KumaScript template to automatically insert links to all subpages. There are two forms of this: (1) a simple list of links, with the text being the title of the destination page; (2) a definition list with the titles being the page titles (linked to the pages) and the descriptions being the pages' summaries.</dd>
  <dt>
    "Insert alphabetical index" button</dt>
  <dd>
    This button would insert, in essence, the APIListAlpha template, which generates an alphabetical list of all subpages, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code" title="The HTML &lt;code> element represents a fragment of computer code. By default, it is displayed in the browser's default monospace font."><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></a> styled. This would be used for lists of API terms.</dd>
  <dt>
    Definition list buttons</dt>
  <dd>
    We need the buttons for creating <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl" title="The HTML &lt;dl> element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms and descriptions. Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs)."><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></a> elements, as well as for <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dt" title="The HTML &lt;dt> element identifies a term in a description list. This element can occur only as a child element of a &lt;dl>. It is usually followed by a &lt;dd> element; however, multiple &lt;dt> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next &lt;dd> element."><code>&lt;dt&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd" title="The HTML &lt;dd> element indicates the description of a term in a description list (&lt;dl>)."><code>&lt;dd&gt;</code></a>. We also need to be sure that editing of and deleting these works reliably (it can be a little quirky right now) if we want to remove source editing eventually; currently you have to resort to source mode sometimes to fit problems with the lists. These lists would be used when we need to include pages that aren't subpages.</dd>
  <dt>
    Bullet list button</dt>
  <dd>
    We need a button for creating <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul" title="The HTML &lt;ul> element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list."><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></a>s, for the offsite link list, for example.</dd>
  <dt>
    Insert image button</dt>
  <dd>
    We need to be able to insert images, to use a product or technology logo somewhere on the page (most likely in the intro area).</dd>
  <dt>
    Link/unlink buttons</dt>
  <dd>
    We need to be able to create and remove links.</dd>
  <dt>
    Bold/italic buttons</dt>
  <dd>
    We should allow creating bold and italic text.</dd>
  <dt>
    API/function name button(s)</dt>
  <dd>
    We need buttons for styling text as the name of a class/interface/function name. Ideally these would have different classes on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code" title="The HTML &lt;code> element represents a fragment of computer code. By default, it is displayed in the browser's default monospace font."><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></a> element for the different types of these, and would automatically create the appropriate link to that term's page, but that may be a long-term goal.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="Editing_features_NOT_needed">Editing features NOT needed</h3>
<p>There are things we expressly do not want to have available in the editor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blockquote</li>
  <li>Tables</li>
  <li>Foreground/background color</li>
  <li>Code samples</li>
  <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre" title='The HTML &amp;amp;lt;pre> element represents preformatted text. Text within this element is typically displayed in a non-proportional ("monospace") font exactly as it is laid out in the file. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as typed.'><code>&lt;pre&gt;</code></a></li>
  <li>Underline</li>
