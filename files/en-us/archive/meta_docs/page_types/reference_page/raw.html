<p>A reference page, or "API term page", describes a single method or property on a class, interface, or object.</p>

<h3 id="Page_title">Page title</h3>
<p>The title is the name of the class, interface, or object the method or property is a member of, then a period, then the name of the API term itself.</p>
<h3 id="Summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The page begins with a summary explaining the interface, object, class, or CSS property being described. This should be a paragraph or two at most, and is used as the SEO summary (which can be overridden using the "seoSummary" CSS class.</p>
<h3 id="Syntax">Syntax</h3>
<p>A box describing the method or property's syntax. This will have a standard appearance site-wide, but the details of its content will depend on the technology being documented.</p>
<h3 id="ValuesParameters">Values/Parameters</h3>
<p>For a property or attribute, its possible values are described here using a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl" title="The HTML &lt;dl> element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms and descriptions. Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs)."><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></a> list or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table" title="The HTML &lt;table> element represents tabular data — that is, information expressed via a two-dimensional data table."><code>&lt;table&gt;</code></a> as appropriate. A definition list is preferred, but a table may be used, for example, to include a small image showing the effect of using each value.</p>
<p>For a method, a list of parameters is displayed instead, as a definition list.</p>
<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>
<p>This section is only included for methods, and specifies the meaning of the return value of the method.</p>
<h3 id="DictionariesOptions">Dictionaries/Options</h3>
<p>If the method uses special objects which are not used elsewhere, they are documented here instead of in a separate page. For example, if a method uses an object with various fields to set custom parameters, it's documented here. Each of these objects has its own subheading, a brief description of what it's for, and a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl" title="The HTML &lt;dl> element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms and descriptions. Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs)."><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></a> listing each field and its purpose.</p>
<h3 id="Examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Next come the examples; these are live samples with text explaining them. If there is only one sample, there are no subheadings. If there are multiple samples, each should be in its own subsection.</p>
<h3 id="Specifications">Specifications</h3>
<p>The specification table comes next.</p>
<h3 id="Browser_compatibility">Browser compatibility</h3>
<p>The last section on the page is the browser compatibility table with any associated notes.</p>
<h2 id="Sidebar">Sidebar</h2>
<h3 id="Table_of_contents">Table of contents</h3>
<p>The first box in the sidebar is the page's TOC. By default, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h2" title="Heading elements implement six levels of document headings, &lt;h1> is the most important and &lt;h6> is the least. A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces. Heading information may be used by user agents, for example, to construct a table of contents for a document automatically."><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h3" title="Heading elements implement six levels of document headings, &lt;h1> is the most important and &lt;h6> is the least. A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces. Heading information may be used by user agents, for example, to construct a table of contents for a document automatically."><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code></a> headings should be listed; this will cover the main sections as well as the names of any examples and dictionaries documented.</p>
<h3 id="API_links">API links</h3>
<p>This box (whose name needs to be determined; perhaps it should be the name of the object or class containing the method or property being documented) contains links to all the other methods and properties on the same object or interface, so the user can quickly get to them.</p>
<h3 id="Related">Related</h3>
<p>This box, which replaces the "See also" section in-content, provides links to related topics. This would, for example, link the user from the page on <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border" title="The border CSS property is a shorthand property for setting all individual border property values at once: border-width, border-style, and border-color. As with all shorthand properties, any individual value that is not specified is set to its corresponding initial value. Importantly, border cannot be used to specify a custom value for border-image, but instead sets it to its initial value, i.e., none."><code>border</code></a> to <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-width" title="The border-width property is a shorthand property for setting the widths on all four sides of an element's border: border-top-width, border-right-width, border-bottom-width, and border-left-width."><code>border-width</code></a> and so forth, or from <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch" title="The Touch interface represents a single contact point on a touch-sensitive device. The contact point is commonly a finger or stylus and the device may be a touchscreen or trackpad."><code>Touch</code></a> to <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchList" title="The TouchList interface represents a list of contact points with a touch surface; for example, if the user has three fingers on the touch surface (such as a screen or trackpad), the corresponding TouchList object would have one Touch object for each finger, for a total of three entries."><code>TouchList</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent" title="The TouchEvent interface represents an event sent when the state of contacts with a touch-sensitive surface changes. This surface can be a touch screen or trackpad, for example. The event can describe one or more points of contact with the screen and includes support for detecting movement, addition and removal of contact points, and so forth."><code>TouchEvent</code></a>, among others.</p>

<p>Do we want the languages for the page listed in the sidebar?</p>
