<p>In the heading area of every page on MDN is a breadcrumb bar showing the hierarchy of content between the site's root and the user's current location. This page discusses that bar and its features.</p>
<h2 id="URL_hierarchy_vs_breadcrumbs">URL hierarchy vs breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>The first thing to note is that the URL hierarchy and the breadcrumb hierarchy need to be decoupled. &lt;&lt;&lt;NEED TO EXPLAIN WHY AND SHOW EXAMPLES&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<h2 id="Breadcrumb_bar_menus">Breadcrumb bar menus</h2>
<p>Each item in the breadcrumb bar should offer a corresponding drop-down menu offering direct and quick access to its subpages. See the <a href="http://www.ajaxblender.com/script-sources/xbreadcrumbs/demo/index.html" title="http://www.ajaxblender.com/script-sources/xbreadcrumbs/demo/index.html">xBreadcrumbs jQuery plugin</a> for an example of the kind of thing we're talking about in action.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<h3 id="Considerations">Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How do we differentiate between going to the landing page clicked on in the breadcrumb bar and opening its menu?</li>
  <li>How do we make it clear there are menus for the breadcrumbs?</li>
  <li>Do we need to present these menus as a separate interface from the breadcrumb bar?</li>
</ul>
