<p><span class="seoSummary">A <strong>landing page</strong> serves as a menu, of sorts, for all of its subpages. It opens with a brief summary of the topic, then presents a structured list of links to subpages, and, optionally, additional material that may be of use.</span></p>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> We are currently finalizing a new standard design for landing pages. Once that&apos;s done, we&apos;ll finish writing this page.</p>
</div>

<p>Writer notes (temp):</p>

<p>This should incorporate the TOC page style from the old &quot;page types&quot; list.</p>
