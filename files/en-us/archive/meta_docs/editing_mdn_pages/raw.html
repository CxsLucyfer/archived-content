<p>This page describes some common tasks when editing MDN pages.</p>
<h2 id="Start_editing_a_page">Start editing a page</h2>
<ul>
 <li>If you are not logged in to MDN, click <strong>Sign In</strong> at the top of the page, and log in using Persona (BrowserID). If necessary, <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:Create_an_account" title="/en-US/docs/Project:Create_an_account">create an account</a>.</li>
 <li>To edit an entire page, click <strong>Edit</strong> at the top of the page. The page switches to edit mode, and shows the contents of the page inside an editor panel.</li>
 <li><strike>To edit a section of a page, click <strong>Edit</strong> next to the heading of the section you want to edit. The editor panel contains only that section, with the rest of the page still read-only.</strike> Wouldn't that be nice! :-)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Save_your_work">Save your work</h2>
<p>The editor in MDN offers multiple ways to check and save your work.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Save changes</strong>: Saves your changes and leaves edit mode, returning the page to reading mode. This is the same as the <strong>Save and Exit</strong> button in the editor toolbar.</li>
 <li><strong>Save and keep editing</strong>: Saves your changes, remaining in edit mode. This is the same as the <strong>Save and Keep Editing</strong> button in the editor toolbar.</li>
 <li><strong>Preview changes</strong>: Renders your changes in another browser tab. This view executes any templates that are referenced in the page, so that you can see how the templates will appear to readers.</li>
 <li><strong>Discard changes</strong>: Throws away your changes since the last save, and returns the page to reading mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><strike>If you are editing a section (not the whole page), you see these buttons:</strike></p>
<ul>
 <li><strike><strong>Save</strong>: Saves your changes and returns to reading mode.</strike></li>
 <li><strike><strong>Cancel</strong>: Discards your changes and returns to reading mode.</strike></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Modify_the_page_info">Modify the page info</h2>
<p>While a page is in edit mode, you can modify some of the page metadata. Click the "i" to open the page info fields.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Title</strong>: The title that appears in the browser title bar and at the top of the page content.</li>
 <li><strong>Slug</strong>: The last part of the URL for the page. Normally, this is based on the page title (appropriate substitutions for spaces and special characters), but you can change it.</li>
 <li><strong>TOC</strong>: If this box is checked, a table-of-contents is automatically generated for the page, based on the headings within the page (up to H4), in a box near the top of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any changes to these fields are saved when you save the page as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="Format_text">Format text</h2>
<p>The editor offers several toolbar buttons to help with formatting text. Some of these of common to many editors and need no explanation.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Source</strong>: Switches the editor from visual editing to HTML source editing.</li>
 <li><strong>H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6</strong>: These buttons correspond <em>exactly</em> to the corresponding HTML heading elements. This is different from the previous version of the MDN editor, where pressing H1 produced &lt;h2&gt;, and so on. Therefore, avoid formatting with H1, as there should be only one &lt;h1&gt; element in a page, and for MDN, that is produced by the page title.</li>
 <li><strong>PRE</strong>: Encloses the selected text in a &lt;pre&gt; element. Clicking this button enables the <strong>Syntax Highlighter</strong> menu next to it, which lets you select the type of code, so that syntax highlighting is applied appropriately.</li>
 <li><strong>Styles</strong>: Selecting an item from this menu surrounds the selected text in a &lt;div&gt; (for block styles) or &lt;span&gt; (for inline styles) element with the corresponding class identifier. This enables the affected text to be appropriately styled by MDN's style sheets.</li>
</ul>
