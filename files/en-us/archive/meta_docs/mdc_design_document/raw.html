<h2 id="Information_Architecture" name="Information_Architecture"> Information Architecture </h2>
<p>MDC is, at its core, a collection of content provided in a system that is built to support the goals and tasks of the supported users. This section of the design document is intended to describe the information architecture that we wish to expose to users through navigation systems, internal nomenclature, and implicit ontologies (yes, yes, despite the fact that <a class="external" href="http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html">ontologies are overrated</a>).
</p><p>This information architecture proposes that any document (<i>"content"</i>) can be classified (as a <i>"content-type"</i>) and categorized in order to provide multiple navigation and organizational schemes. Further, there will be classifications for the categories (<i>"category-types"</i>) to provide further structure. The architecture allows:
</p>
<ul><li> any <i>content</i> is of a single <i>content-type</i>
</li><li> any <i>category</i> is of a single <i>category-type</i>
</li><li> any <i>content</i> to exist in 1..n <i>categories</i>
</li><li> users to navigate within <i>content-type</i> (with <i>content</i> sorted by <i>category</i>)
</li><li> users to navigate within <i>category</i> (with <i>content</i> sorted by <i>content-type</i>)
</li></ul>
<p>(<b>note:</b> MDC is actually implimented as a wiki, two wordpress blogs, and some static pages; as such, all of the sorting options may not be immediately available)
</p>
<h3 id="Content_Types" name="Content_Types"> Content Types </h3>
<p>Documents are sorted into content-types in order to provide a mechanism for users to sort by the type of thing they are looking for (ie: <a href="en/Useful_CSS_tips">tips &amp; tricks</a> vs. <a href="en/NsIComponentRegistrar">API reference</a>) which in turn provides supports for various user tasks (ie: "How can I use CSS on my website?" vs. "What parameters does this method take?").
</p><p>Users should be given a clear indication of the difference in content-types, and be able to use that indication to find the information that they are looking for.
</p><p>There are four types of content: news &amp; events), articles, reference, and external resources.
</p>
<ul><li> News &amp; Events
<ul><li> announcements about new releases, API changes, working groups, etc
</li><li> event listings for public meetings, conferences, discussions, etc
</li><li> <i>this content is stored within the <a class="external" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/|MDC">DevNews weblog</a></i>
</li></ul>
</li><li> Articles
<ul><li> commentary or discussion of a technology or tool
</li><li> HOW-TOs, guides, tutorials and worked examples
</li><li> prognostication, musing or any other thought-piece
</li><li> <i>this content is stored within the MDC Wiki</i>
</li></ul>
</li><li> Reference Material
<ul><li> code documentation (manually or automatically generated)
</li><li> process documentation
</li><li> product documentation (including release notes &amp; roadmaps) </li><li> developer tool manuals (?)
</li><li> <i>this content is stored within the MDC Wiki</i>
</li></ul>
</li><li> External Resources
<ul><li> annotated links to trusted external resources
</li><li> <i>this content is provided by <a class="external" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/webwatch/|MDC">WebWatch weblog</a></i>
</li></ul>
</li><li> Samples (when "raw" feature is available -- should be sooner rather than later)
<ul><li> ready-to-use examples to explore and/or download &amp; use
</li><li> <i>this content is stored within the MDC Wiki</i>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h3 id="Category_Types" name="Category_Types"> Category Types </h3>
<p>In addition to being <i>of</i> a content type, conent can be part of 1..n categories. Categories offer a mechanism for semantic organization, and multiple categorization provides a mechanism for a flexible ontology.
</p><p>To further organize things, categories are typed as into category-types which serve as ways to sort content by user audience (ie: newbies vs. experts) and user goal (ie: build an extension vs. learn about the release process). The architecture proposes three category types: reference libraries, technology topics and developer topics.
</p>
<ul><li> Reference Library
<ul><li> contains reference content for a specific topic (ie: SpiderMonkey, Mozilla Development Process)
</li><li> topics can be created for code libraries, processes, tools and products
</li></ul>
</li><li> Technology Topics
<ul><li> contains article content, external resources, and links to references </li><li> focuses on a specific technology-based topic (ie: DOM, AJAX)
</li></ul>
</li><li> Developer Topics (articles, examples, links/references)
<ul><li> contains article content, external resources, and links to references </li><li> focuses on a non-specific set of processes or methodologies (ie: Accessability, Making an Extention)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h2 id="Presentation_&amp;_Implementation" name="Presentation_&amp;_Implementation"> Presentation &amp; Implementation </h2>
<p>MDC will be implemented as a set of MediaWiki wikis (one per language) and two WordPress weblogs. The MediaWikis will house the primary content (articles, reference material and samples) and the weblogs will be used for content that is being regularly updated (news &amp; events, external resources).
</p><p>The MediaWiki and weblogs will all be presented as a single information hub, and should have a consistent look &amp; feel. Design elements should be reused so that to a casual user, the difference between wiki and weblog is minimal.
</p><p>The following mockups and descriptions are meant to give guideance about the presentation of the information architecture, but not neccessarily to influence the final "look-and-feel" of MDC.
</p>
<h3 id="Types_of_Pages" name="Types_of_Pages"> Types of Pages </h3>
<p>The layout of MDC pages will be determined by the type of content on that page. Below are links to block layouts and descriptions of how the various pages should look. The layout differences should be accomplished by a combination of Wiki skins, WordPress templates and CSS.
</p>
<ul><li> <a>MDC Home Page</a>
</li><li> <a>MDC Topic Page</a>
</li><li> <a>MDC Reference Library Page</a>
</li><li> <a>MDC News Index Page</a>
</li><li> <a>MDC Community Index Page</a>
</li><li> <a>MDC WebWatch Index Page</a>
</li><li> <a>MDC Article Index Page</a>
</li><li> <a>MDC Reference Index Page</a>
</li><li> <a>MDC Content Page</a>
</li><li> <a>MDC Content Page (for printing)</a>
</li></ul>
<h3 id="Common_Elements" name="Common_Elements"> Common Elements </h3>
<p>All MDC pages will feature some or all of the following common elements (<b>TBD: there may be some implementation limitations here</b>), and although the content will change depending on the page, the elements should always look the same:
</p>
<ul><li> <a>Navigation Bar</a>
</li><li> <a>Search Box</a>
</li><li> <a>Side Bar</a>
</li><li> <a>Page Tools</a>
</li><li> <a>Footer</a>
</li></ul>
<h2 id="Scenarios_&amp;_Walkthroughs" name="Scenarios_&amp;_Walkthroughs"> Scenarios &amp; Walkthroughs </h2>
<p>Some sample scenario walkthroughs to guide the implementation and design of the site.
</p>
<ul><li> <a>Searching for information</a>
</li><li> <a>Returning user</a>
</li><li> <a>Contribution and maintenance</a>
</li></ul>
