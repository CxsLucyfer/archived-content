<p>Each page on MDC should feature a prominently located Search Box that has a search field and button.

<dl><dd> I think for the main search box, for now, we'll use a google search limited by site domain (like the main search on mozilla.org). If that turns out to be insufficient (ie: people really want the wiki search box back for whatever reason), we'll sort out where to stick it at that point.
