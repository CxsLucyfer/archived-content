<p>Welcome to the Mozilla Developer Center! Here you&apos;ll find documentation for not only working on the code and other components of the Mozilla project, but also for developing add-ons for Mozilla-based software, creating new software based on Mozilla code, and web development for the open Web.</p>

<p>The most important thing to note about the Mozilla Developer Center is that it is a community-driven documentation project. If you see an error, or find that there&apos;s some content missing, you can contribute the correction yourself! Simply create a new account on the wiki and then click the &quot;Edit page&quot; link near the top of the page that needs work.</p>

<p>Worried that your writing skills aren&apos;t up to snuff? Don&apos;t be! Happy, helpful documentation gnomes constantly monitor the site, looking for grammatical and other errors, and will clean up after you if your English grammar skills aren&apos;t as good as your wicked coding skills.</p>

<p>The rest of this article provides helpful information about using the MDC web site.</p>

<h2 id="Finding_what_you_need">Finding what you need</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can find the information you need. First off, you can <a href="/en" class="internal" title="en/">start at the main page</a>, and follow the menu links to narrow your way down toward the article that will help you the most.</p>

<p>You can also search the site by entering search terms in the search box near the top-right corner of the page. One helpful tip here: because MDC uses <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" class="external" title="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> to power its search, you can use powerful Lucene queries when searching MDC.</p>

<p>For example, to limit your search only to article titles, you can do something like:</p>

<pre>title:&quot;extension&quot;
</pre>

<p>This will return only articles with the word &quot;extension&quot; in their titles.</p>

<p>You can also perform proximity searches. For example, to find articles in which the words &quot;video&quot; and &quot;ogg&quot; are used within 10 words of each other, you can do this:</p>

<pre>&quot;video ogg&quot;-10
</pre>

<p>For more information about Lucene search syntax, check out the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/queryparsersyntax.html" class="external" title="http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/queryparsersyntax.html">Lucene parser query syntax documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Also, if you&apos;re an expert at Mozilla concepts, there&apos;s a <a href="/En/Documentation_hot_links" class="internal" title="En/Documentation hot links">special page that provides direct links</a> to specific topic areas. This can reduce the amount of drilling down through menus you need to do.</p>

<h2 id="Editing_content">Editing content</h2>

<p>MDC uses a what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) editor to edit its content. See the <a href="/Project:En/MDC_editor_guide" class="internal" title="Project:En/MDC editor guide">MDC editor guide</a> for details.</p>
