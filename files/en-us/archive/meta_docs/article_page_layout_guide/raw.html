<p><span class="seoSummary">An <strong>article</strong> is any page that explains or teaches something. These are non-reference pages which are also not landing pages. In general, if a page is primarily prose and/or sample code, it's an article.</span> These pages typically involve prose, optionally interspersed with code snippets, live samples, and/or screenshots and other images. Article pages include tutorials, guides, and other how-to type documents.</p>

<h2 id="Multi-article_tutorials">Multi-article tutorials</h2>

<p>When creating a series of related articles, such as a multi-page tutorial, there are some special guidelines to follow:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The first page should offer a list of prerequisites; that is, a list of things the reader should already know and what pre-existing code they need from previous examples, if any.</li>
 <li>Each part of the article series, if it builds upon code from an earlier part, should offer a download link to quickly get that code.</li>
 <li>Each article should have "previous" and/or "next" links at both the top and the bottom of the article. Use the macros <span class="templateLink"><code><a href="https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/tree/master/macros/Previous.ejs">Previous</a></code></span>, <span class="templateLink"><code><a href="https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/tree/master/macros/Next.ejs">Next</a></code></span>, and <span class="templateLink"><code><a href="https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/tree/master/macros/PreviousNext.ejs">PreviousNext</a></code></span>.</li>
</ul>
