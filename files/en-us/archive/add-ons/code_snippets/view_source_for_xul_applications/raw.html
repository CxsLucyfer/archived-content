<div class="warning">
<p>Support for extensions using XUL/XPCOM or the Add-on SDK was removed in Firefox 57, released November 2017. As there is no supported version of Firefox enabling these technologies, this page will be removed by December 2020.</p>

<p>Add-ons using the techniques described in this document are considered a legacy technology in Firefox. Don't use these techniques to develop new add-ons. Use <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions">WebExtensions</a> instead. If you maintain an add-on which uses the techniques described here, consider migrating it to use WebExtensions.</p>

<p><strong>Starting from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar">Firefox 53</a>, no new legacy add-ons will be accepted on addons.mozilla.org (AMO) for desktop Firefox and Firefox for Android.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Starting from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar">Firefox 57</a>, only extensions developed using WebExtensions APIs will be supported on Desktop Firefox and Firefox for Android. </strong></p>

<p>Even before Firefox 57, changes coming up in the Firefox platform will break many legacy extensions. These changes include multiprocess Firefox (e10s), sandboxing, and multiple content processes. Legacy extensions that are affected by these changes should migrate to use WebExtensions APIs if they can. See the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/02/16/the-road-to-firefox-57-compatibility-milestones/">"Compatibility Milestones" document</a> for more information.</p>

<p>A wiki page containing <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/developer/communication">resources, migration paths, office hours, and more</a>, is available to help developers transition to the new technologies.</p>

<h2 id="Importing_gViewSourceUtils">Importing gViewSourceUtils</h2>

<p>XUL applications wanting to show the source code for documents should import the <code>viewSourceUtils.js</code> script instead of attempting to open the <code>viewSource.xul</code> window themselves:</p>

<pre class="brush: xml"><code class="highlighted" id="line-14">&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="chrome://global/content/viewSourceUtils.js"/&gt;</code></pre>

<p><code>viewSourceUtils.js</code> exposes a <code>gViewSourceUtils</code> global into the scope of the window that imports that script.</p>

<h2 id="Method_overview">Method overview</h2>

<p><code>gViewSourceUtils</code> exposes several methods, but the only one you should be using directly is the <code>viewSource</code> method. The rest of those methods should be considered private, and might become inaccessible in the future.</p>

  <tr>
   <td>void <a href="#viewSource">viewSource</a>(aObject);</td>

<h3 id="viewSource_2"><a id="viewSource" name="viewSource">viewSource</a></h3>

<p>Opens a viewer to the source code for some document or URI.</p>

<h4 id="Parameters">Parameters</h4>

<p>The <code>viewSource</code> method takes an Object as its first and only parameter. The Object can include the following properties:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>URL (required)</dt>
 <dd>A string URL for the document to view the source of.</dd>
 <dt>browser (optional)</dt>
 <dd>The browser containing the document that we would like to view the source of. This is optional if outerWindowID is not passed.</dd>
 <dt>outerWindowID (optional)</dt>
 <dd>The outerWindowID of the content window containing the document that we want to view the source of. Pass this if you want to attempt to load the document source out of the network cache.</dd>
 <dt>lineNumber (optional)</dt>
 <dd>The line number to focus on once the source has loaded.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="Deprecated_API">Deprecated API</h4>

<div class="warning">
<p>This API is likely to go away in the future, and should no longer be used.</p>
</div>

<p> The <code>viewSource</code> method will also accept the following arguments in place of the Object:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>aURL</dt>
 <dd>A string URL for the document to view the source of.</dd>
 <dt>aPageDescriptor (optional)</dt>
 <dd>A "descriptor" that allows the source to be retrieved from the network cache. This is usually gotten from the <code>nsIWebPageDescriptor</code> interface via <code>currentDescriptor</code>.</dd>
 <dt>aDocument (optional)</dt>
 <dd>The content document that we're attempting to load the source from.</dd>
 <dt>aLineNumber (optional)</dt>
