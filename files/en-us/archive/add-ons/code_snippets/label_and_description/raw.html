<div class="warning">
<p>Support for extensions using XUL/XPCOM or the Add-on SDK was removed in Firefox 57, released November 2017. As there is no supported version of Firefox enabling these technologies, this page will be removed by December 2020.</p>

<p>Add-ons using the techniques described in this document are considered a legacy technology in Firefox. Don't use these techniques to develop new add-ons. Use <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions">WebExtensions</a> instead. If you maintain an add-on which uses the techniques described here, consider migrating it to use WebExtensions.</p>

<p><strong>Starting from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar">Firefox 53</a>, no new legacy add-ons will be accepted on addons.mozilla.org (AMO) for desktop Firefox and Firefox for Android.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Starting from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar">Firefox 57</a>, only extensions developed using WebExtensions APIs will be supported on Desktop Firefox and Firefox for Android. </strong></p>

<p>Even before Firefox 57, changes coming up in the Firefox platform will break many legacy extensions. These changes include multiprocess Firefox (e10s), sandboxing, and multiple content processes. Legacy extensions that are affected by these changes should migrate to use WebExtensions APIs if they can. See the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/02/16/the-road-to-firefox-57-compatibility-milestones/">"Compatibility Milestones" document</a> for more information.</p>

<p>A wiki page containing <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/developer/communication">resources, migration paths, office hours, and more</a>, is available to help developers transition to the new technologies.</p>

<h3 id="Line_breaking" name="Line_breaking">Line breaking</h3>

<p>Under normal conditions, a description will not break long-running text and the text may be cropped or hidden. To cause the text to wrap:</p>

<p>Ensure the long-running text is a <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-core.html#ID-1312295772">text node</a> child of &lt;description/&gt; or &lt;label/&gt; (i.e., do not specify the long-running text in the value attribute of these elements).</p>

<p>The default style for these XUL elements includes <code>white-space: wrap;</code>. This reduces all whitespace chunks (including newlines) to single spaces. Text is permitted to wrap.</p>

<pre>&lt;description&gt;I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate. What's that make us? Absolutely nothing!&lt;/description&gt;
</pre>

<p>With <code>white-space: pre;</code> all whitespace, including newlines, is rendered literally. Text cannot wrap automatically but can still be achieved with &lt;html:br/&gt; if desired.</p>

<pre>&lt;description style="white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate. What's that make us? Absolutely nothing!&lt;/description&gt;
</pre>

<p>With <code>white-space: pre-wrap;</code> all whitespace is rendered literally, but text is additionally permitted to wrap at spaces.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Prior to Firefox 3, it was necessary to use <code>-moz-pre-wrap</code> instead of <code>-pre-wrap</code>.  You may wish to use both for backward compatibility.</div>

<pre>&lt;description style="white-space: pre;"&gt;I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate.
 What's that make us?
 Absolutely nothing!&lt;/description&gt;
</pre>

<p>Text can also be made to wrap by inserting an &lt;html:br/&gt; element regardless of the CSS style, but this creates a hard-break that does not change as parent elements resize.</p>

<pre>&lt;description&gt;I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate.&lt;html:br/&gt;
What's that make us?&lt;html:br/&gt;
Absolutely nothing!&lt;/description&gt;

<h3 id="Using_labels_as_anchors" name="Using_labels_as_anchors">Using labels as anchors</h3>

<p>Its possible to make a label look and act like an HTML &lt;a&gt; tag:</p>

<pre class="eval"><span class="nowiki">&lt;label class="text-link" href="http://whatever.com" value="click here to go to whatever"/&gt;</span>
</pre>

<p>"text-link" is a built-in, predefined class.</p>

<div class="note">Note: if running in a XULRunner application add the following preferences to your default preferences file:
<pre class="eval">pref("network.protocol-handler.expose.http", false);
pref("network.protocol-handler.warn-external.http", false);
</pre>

<p>Change or add additional protocols (https or ftp) as needed.</p>
