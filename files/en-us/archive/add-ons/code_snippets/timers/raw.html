<div class="warning">
<p>Support for extensions using XUL/XPCOM or the Add-on SDK was removed in Firefox 57, released November 2017. As there is no supported version of Firefox enabling these technologies, this page will be removed by December 2020.</p>

<p>Add-ons using the techniques described in this document are considered a legacy technology in Firefox. Don't use these techniques to develop new add-ons. Use <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions">WebExtensions</a> instead. If you maintain an add-on which uses the techniques described here, consider migrating it to use WebExtensions.</p>

<p><strong>Starting from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar">Firefox 53</a>, no new legacy add-ons will be accepted on addons.mozilla.org (AMO) for desktop Firefox and Firefox for Android.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Starting from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar">Firefox 57</a>, only extensions developed using WebExtensions APIs will be supported on Desktop Firefox and Firefox for Android. </strong></p>

<p>Even before Firefox 57, changes coming up in the Firefox platform will break many legacy extensions. These changes include multiprocess Firefox (e10s), sandboxing, and multiple content processes. Legacy extensions that are affected by these changes should migrate to use WebExtensions APIs if they can. See the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/02/16/the-road-to-firefox-57-compatibility-milestones/">"Compatibility Milestones" document</a> for more information.</p>

<p>A wiki page containing <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/developer/communication">resources, migration paths, office hours, and more</a>, is available to help developers transition to the new technologies.</p>

<p>A block of JavaScript code is generally executed synchronously. But there are some JavaScript native functions (<em>timers</em>) which allow us to delay the execution of arbitrary instructions:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout" title="Calls a function or executes a code snippet after a specified delay."><code>setTimeout()</code></a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setInterval" title="Calls a function or executes a code snippet repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each call to that function. Returns an intervalID."><code>setInterval()</code></a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setImmediate" title="This method is used to break up long running operations and run a callback function immediately after the browser has completed other operations such as events and display updates."><code>setImmediate()</code></a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame" title="You should call this method whenever you're ready to update your animation onscreen. This will request that your animation function be called before the browser performs the next repaint. The number of callbacks is usually 60 times per second, but will generally match the display refresh rate in most web browsers as per W3C recommendation. requestAnimationFrame() calls are paused in most browsers when running in background tabs or hidden &lt;iframe>s in order to improve performance and battery life."><code>requestAnimationFrame()</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>setTimeout()</code> function is commonly used if you wish to have your function called <em>once</em> after the specified delay. The <code>setInterval()</code> function is commonly used to set a delay for functions that are executed again and again, such as animations. The <code>setImmediate()</code> function can be used instead of the <code>setTimeout(<em>fn</em>, <strong>0</strong>)</code> method to execute heavy operations in IE. The <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code> function tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser schedule a repaint of the window for the next animation frame.</p>

 <dd>In Computer science a <em>daemon</em> is a task that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. In JavaScript programming language, all <em>daemons</em> are processes created by JavaScript timers or by a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker" title="The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator.
