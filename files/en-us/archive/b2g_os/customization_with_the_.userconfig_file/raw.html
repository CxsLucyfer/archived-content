<div class="summary">
<p>You can customize certain aspects of the build process by putting some bash code into your B2G source's <code>.userconfig</code> file. This article looks at what you can achieve by making changes here, and how to do that.</p>
</div>

<p>The <code>.userconfig</code> file isn't checked into source code control, so your changes won't be overwritten when you update your source tree. It needs to be created in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G">root of the B2G tree</a>; that is, in the same directory as <code>flash.sh</code>, <code>build.sh</code>, and so forth. You should add this before you run your config and build steps.</p>

<p>The <code>.userconfig</code> file, if it exists, is sourced by the <code>load-config.sh</code> script, which is in turn sourced by these scripts: <code>flash.sh</code>, <code>build.sh</code> (through <code>setup.sh</code>), <code>run-gdb.sh</code>, <code>run-emulator.sh</code> and <code>tools/mach_b2g_bootstrap.py</code>. The <code>run-<em>*</em>.sh</code> scripts use it to determine where Gecko is for your build. The <code>mach_b2g_boostrap.py</code> script is used by every B2G related <a href="/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/mach">mach</a> command.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Your <code>.userconfig</code> file should be in the root of your B2G source directory, not your home directory!</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Changing_the_Gecko_source_tree">Changing the Gecko source tree</h2>

<p>By default, the build uses the gecko tree, which is cloned from a tree in github. Some people like to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Mercurial#mozilla-inbound_%28used_for_landing_your_patches%29" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Mercurial#mozilla-inbound_%28used_for_landing_your_patches%29">mozilla-inbound</a>, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Mercurial#mozilla-central_%28main_development_tree%29" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Mercurial#mozilla-central_%28main_development_tree%29">mozilla-central</a>. To do this create your clone whereever you like and add a line to your <code>.userconfig</code> which sets <code>GECKO_PATH</code>, for example:</p>

<pre>export B2G_DIR=${B2G_DIR:-$(cd $(dirname $0); pwd)}
echo "B2G_DIR = ${B2G_DIR}"

export GECKO_PATH=${B2G_DIR}/mozilla-inbound
echo "GECKO_PATH = ${GECKO_PATH}"
</pre>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if building against a custom Gecko in Mac OS X, the <code>mozilla-central</code> directory must be in a case sensitive file system or else <code>GECKO_PATH</code> will be ignored. You can check whether the file system is case sensitive by running this in a Terminal window:</p>

<pre>echo -n This file system is case-&gt;tmp; echo -n in&gt;&gt;TMP; echo sensitive&gt;&gt;tmp; cat tmp</pre>

<p>Getting <code>B2G_DIR</code> the way it is above allows your <code>.userconfig</code> to work without having hard-coded paths.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Changing_Gaia_settings">Changing Gaia settings</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you'd like to be able to change gaia settings. For example, enabling adb in a user build. The gaia Makefile passes in <code>--override build/custom-settings.json</code> when calling <code>build/settings.py</code>, so we can write some bash which will write <code>{"devtools.debugger.remote-enabled": true}</code> into the <code>custom-settings.json</code> file. We try to avoid changing <code>custom-settings.json</code> if we don't need to, so we actually write into <code>custom-settings.json.new</code> and if the contents differ from <code>custom-settings.json</code> then we'll replace it.</p>

<pre>export GAIA_PATH=${GAIA_PATH:-$(cd gaia; pwd)}
export CUSTOM_SETTINGS="${GAIA_PATH}/build/config/custom-settings.json"
cat &gt; "${CUSTOM_SETTINGS}.new" &lt;&lt;EOF
{"devtools.debugger.remote-enabled": true}
EOF
if [[ -f ${CUSTOM_SETTINGS} ]] &amp;&amp; cmp "${CUSTOM_SETTINGS}" "${CUSTOM_SETTINGS}.new" &gt;&amp; /dev/null; then
  rm "${CUSTOM_SETTINGS}.new"
else
  mv "${CUSTOM_SETTINGS}.new" "${CUSTOM_SETTINGS}"
fi
</pre>

<p>Another easier way is to configure a <code>build/config/custom-prefs.js</code> file in the Gaia working directory, so that means in <code>gaia/build/config/custom-prefs.js</code> if you're in the B2G directory. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Platform/Gaia/Build_System_Primer#Customizing_the_preferences" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Platform/Gaia/Build_System_Primer#Customizing_the_preferences">Gaia Build System Primer, Customizing the preferences</a>.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Currently the build is not smart enough to look in a different directory based on <code>GAIA_PATH</code>.  This is different from how <code>GECKO_PATH</code> behaves.  If you wish to use a separate Gaia clone you can <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Platform/Gaia/Build_System_Primer" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Platform/Gaia/Build_System_Primer">manually run make</a> from that directory.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Creating_different_build_types">Creating different build types</h2>

<p>You can create many different types of Gaia build automatically upon running the make command, by setting various options in your <code>.userconfig </code>— this section covers a number of different options. </p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also set many different build options dynamically at build time by including different options along with the make command when you build. For a complete reference, see our <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developing_Gaia/make_options_reference">make options reference</a> article.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Creating_production_and_engineering_builds">Creating production and engineering builds</h3>

<p>To create different production builds (built with the final apps you'd want users to see) and engineering builds (built with additional test apps and other engineering features), you can add the following lines into <code>.userconfig</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">PRODUCTION=1</pre>

<p class="p1">On its own, this creates a production build. This can also be achieved on the fly by setting the <code>production</code> make option.</p>

<p class="p1">Alternatively, there are variants, which set various levels of engineering capabilities:</p>

<pre class="p1">VARIANT=user

VARIANT=userdebug

VARIANT=eng</pre>

<p class="p1">The differences between these variants are as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li class="p1">The <strong>eng</strong> variant places the default apps in <code>/data</code> and includes many more apps than user/userdebug, for testing purposes. It also has Marionette enabled by default so you can run tests. This is the default value if no variant is specified.</li>
 <li class="p1">The <strong>userdebug</strong> variant puts apps in <code>/system</code>, has Marionette enabled by default so you can run tests, and has the updater enabled, so you can get over-the-air (OTA/FOTA) updates.</li>
 <li class="p1">The <strong>user</strong> variant places the default apps in <code>/system</code> and has the updater enabled, so you can get over-the-air (OTA/FOTA) updates.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p class="p1"><strong>Note</strong>: user and userdebug both imply <code>PRODUCTION=1</code> when building locally for a real device/emulator.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <code style="font-style: normal;">make production</code> is really a way to build a user version of Gaia and flash it to the device. Specifying a <code style="font-style: normal;">VARIANT</code> is the way to do this when building for Gaia in Nightly or B2G Desktop.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Creating_a_debug_build">Creating a debug build</h3>

<p>To build a debug build, put the following line in your <code>.userconfig</code> file:</p>

<pre>export B2G_DEBUG=1</pre>

<p>This can be achieved on the fly at build time by including the <span style="line-height: 1.5;"><code>DEBUG=1</code> make option.</span></p>

<h3 id="Creating_a_profiling_build">Creating a profiling build</h3>

<p>To enable profiling (for best results with the built-in (SPS) platform profiler), add the following to your <code>.userconfig</code> file then rebuild:</p>

<pre>export B2G_PROFILING=1</pre>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Do NOT pair with B2G_NOOPT. The results will be meaningless!</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Disabling_the_optimizer">Disabling the optimizer</h3>

<p>To disable the optimizer (which may create builds that are easier to debug), add the following to your <code>.userconfig</code> file then rebuild:</p>

<pre>export B2G_NOOPT=1</pre>

<h3 id="Disabling_First_Time_User_experience">Disabling First Time User experience</h3>

<p>If you build and reflash a lot, going through the First Time User experience constantly can be annoying. You can disable this by adding the following to your <code>.userconfig</code>:</p>

<pre>export NOFTU=1</pre>

<p>This can be achieved on the fly at build time by including the <code>NOFTU=1</code> make option.</p>

<h3 id="Building_the_updater_and_the_update_tools">Building the updater and the update tools</h3>

<p>By default the updater and the update tools are built only in <strong>userdebug</strong> and <strong>user</strong> builds.</p>

<p>You can force building the updater and the associated tools by adding the following to your <code>.userconfig</code> file:</p>

<pre>export B2G_UPDATER=1</pre>

<h2 id="Enabling_Gaia_developer_mode">Enabling Gaia developer mode</h2>

<p>If you plan to develop apps or hack gaia, you can automatically set various usefull settings and preferences to ease working with the device. For example, it will automatically enable the remote debugging feature and disable the prompt when an incoming debugging connection starts.</p>

<p>What you need is the following export added to your <code>.userconfig</code>:</p>

<pre>export DEVICE_DEBUG=1</pre>

<h2 id="Enabling_Valgrind">Enabling Valgrind</h2>

<p>Valgrind is a debugging tool useful for debugging memory or threading issues with your application. For more information on running valgrind, see <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Debugging_B2G_using_valgrind">Debugging B2G using valgrind</a>.</p>

<p>To use valgrind under B2G, add the following to your <code>.userconfig</code>:</p>

<pre>export B2G_VALGRIND=1</pre>

<h2 id="Changing_the_default_host_compiler">Changing the default host compiler</h2>

<p>On some recent distributions that use GCC 4.7 or later as the default compiler you might need to specify an older version in order to be able to build, depending on your platform of choice. To do so add two lines to your <code>.userconfig</code> file, setting the <code>CC</code> and <code>CXX</code> variables to set the alternate C and C++ compilers, respectively. For example to set the GCC 4.6 compiler on Ubuntu 12.10 use:</p>

<pre>export CC=gcc-4.6
export CXX=g++-4.6
</pre>

<p>Or if you're using a version built from sources provide the full path to the exectuables:</p>

<pre>export CC=/opt/gcc-4.6.4/bin/gcc
export CXX=/opt/gcc-4.6.4/bin/g++
</pre>

<h2 id="Specifying_a_custom_Gecko_object_tree_location">Specifying a custom Gecko object tree location</h2>

<p>Once you start changing gecko source trees and other build options, you may want to also modify where your objects get stored (so, for example, all of your debug objects go into a different tree from your non-debug objects). So you might do something like:</p>

<pre>export GECKO_OBJDIR=${GECKO_PATH}/objdir-gonk-debug
</pre>

<p>Using <code>${GECKO_PATH}</code> makes it easy to switch between different gecko trees (eg: central, beta, aurora, etc).</p>

<h2 id="Keeping_both_debug_and_non-debug_objects">Keeping both debug and non-debug objects</h2>

<p>You can use your <code>.userconfig</code> file to switch back and forth between debug and release builds without having to rebuild everything each time!</p>

<dl>
</dl>

<pre class="brush:bash;">export B2G_DIR=${B2G_DIR:-$(cd $(dirname $0); pwd)}
echo "B2G_DIR = ${B2G_DIR}"

export GECKO_PATH=${B2G_DIR}/mozilla-inbound
echo "GECKO_PATH = ${GECKO_PATH}"

export B2G_DEBUG=1
echo "B2G_DEBUG = ${B2G_DEBUG}"

export GECKO_OBJDIR=${GECKO_PATH}/objdir-gonk
if [[ "${B2G_DEBUG}" != "0" ]]; then
  export GECKO_OBJDIR=${GECKO_OBJDIR}-debug
fi
if [[ "${GECKO_PATH/*mozilla-inbound*/mozilla-inbound}" == "mozilla-inbound" ]]; then
  export GECKO_OBJDIR=${GECKO_OBJDIR}-m-i
fi
echo "GECKO_OBJDIR = ${GECKO_OBJDIR}"</pre>

<p>The <code>echo</code> commands help remind you what your current settings are. To switch between debug and release builds, simply change the value of <code>B2G_DEBUG</code> on line 7.</p>
