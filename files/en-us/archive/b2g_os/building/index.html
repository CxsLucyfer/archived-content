<p><span class="seoSummary">Once you&apos;ve <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites" title="Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites">set up your build system</a> and performed your <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Preparing_for_your_first_B2G_build" title="Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Preparing_for_your_first_B2G_build">initial pull and configure</a>  the code, you can build Boot to Gecko. This guide explains how.</span></p>
</div>

<h2 id="Updating_your_code">Updating your code</h2>

<p>If this isn&apos;t your very first time building B2G, you might want to pull the latest code before you start to build. To do that, update both the B2G tools and the dependencies, using the following two commands:</p>

<pre>git pull
./repo sync -d
</pre>

<p>The -d option switches the various projects HEAD back to their Android manifest revision (i.e the default mainstream repository version). It is helpful if you made modifications to the repos (and have associated source changes) but you need to revert back to the master version temporarily. It will indeed leave your stagnant or working directory changes untouched (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11448864/what-is-the-usage-for-repo-sync-d-in-android-source-repository">the following SO question</a> for the full explanation). If you did not touch the source code, you can use the normal command:</p>

<pre>git pull
./repo sync</pre>

<p>You can update a specific  target&apos;s repository by specifying its name:</p>

<pre>./repo sync gaia
</pre>

<p>The repo command has other options available that might be interesting; <code>repo help</code> will provide with a lot of information.</p>

<h2 id="Building_Boot_to_Gecko">Building Boot to Gecko</h2>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before building, you may want to set up a <code>.userconfig</code> file to customize the build. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Customization_with_the_.userconfig_file" title="Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Customization_with_the_.userconfig_file">Customization with the .userconfig file</a> for details.</p>
</div>

<p>To build Boot to Gecko, simply use the <code>build.sh</code> tool:</p>

<pre>cd B2G
./build.sh
</pre>

<p>Time for another coffee break, or possibly a nap (especially if this is your first build, it takes about 30 min on a Core i7 with 8GB of RAM). As in the configure step on the previous page, if you are using a directory of previously-extracted Android system files, you should set <code>ANDROIDFS_DIR</code> before running <code>build.sh</code>.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For more instructions on flashing your new build to a phone, read <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Installing_on_a_mobile_device">Installing B2G OS on a mobile device</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Building_specific_modules">Building specific modules</h3>

<p>If you want to build just a particular module, such as Gecko, you can specify it by name:</p>

<pre>./build.sh gecko
</pre>

<p>In order to refresh only one application, you can build only <code>gaia</code> module by using the <code>BUILD_APP_NAME</code> environment variable:</p>

<pre>BUILD_APP_NAME=calendar ./build.sh gaia</pre>

<p>To get a list of the modules you can build, you can do:</p>

<pre>./build.sh modules
</pre>

<h3 id="Setting_the_number_of_processor_cores_to_use">Setting the number of processor cores to use</h3>

<p>By default, the B2G build scripts use the number of cores your system has plus twice the number of parallel tasks to run. You can change this by specifying the <code>-j</code> parameter when running <code>build.sh</code>. This can be handy if you&apos;re using your system for other things while building in the background and need to reduce CPU load a bit. It&apos;s also handy when you&apos;re having build problems, as it can make reading error output from the build process easier if you have just one task going at a time!</p>

<p>For example, to build using just two parallel tasks:</p>

<pre>./build.sh -j2
</pre>

<p>The most common use case for this, however, is to prevent builds from running in parallel at all. This makes the output of the process much easier to read, making it easier to sort out build problems. To do this:</p>

<pre>./build.sh -j1
</pre>

<h3 id="Building_multilocale">Building multilocale</h3>

<p>To create a multilocale build, do the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Determine which Gaia languages file to use. We&apos;re currently using <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/locales/languages_dev.json"><code>locales/languages_dev.json</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/locales/languages_all.json"><code>locales/languages_all.json</code></a> as our Gaia languages files.</li>
 <li>Clone the appropriate locales from <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/gaia-l10n">http://hg.mozilla.org/gaia-l10n</a> into a directory; we use <code>gaia-l10n/</code>. You could use the <code>locales/</code> directory . You&apos;ll need to clone a repo for each locale listed in the languages file.</li>
 <li>In your environment, set <code>LOCALE_BASEDIR</code> to the absolute path of the directory in step 2. Set <code>LOCALES_FILE</code> to the absolute path of the file in step 1.</li>
 <li>Also, you can set a <code>GAIA_DEFAULT_LOCALE</code> if you want to set a default locale.</li>
</ol>

<pre style="font-size: 12px;">cd gaia/locales/
hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/gaia-l10n/v2_5/es</pre>

<div>Set your environment variables:</div>

<div> </div>

<pre>export LOCALE_BASEDIR=$PWD/locales
export LOCALES_FILE=$PWD/locales/languages_dev.json
export GAIA_DEFAULT_LOCALE=es
</pre>

<p>And the <code>languages-dev.json</code> could be replaced by your own <code>languages-own.json</code> path, which could formed like this. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">You would need to add an entry per each repo cloned in your locales directory.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>

<pre>{
  &quot;en-US&quot;     : &quot;English (US)&quot;,
  &quot;es&quot;        : &quot;Español&quot;
}
</pre>

<p>Since bug 884752 landed (November 2013), to add keyboard layouts (if available in Gaia), you can use parameter GAIA_KEYBOARD_LAYOUTS. </p>

<p>Bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=884752</p>

<p>Layouts: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/v1.2/keyboard/layouts</p>

<p>For example, to add Spanish and Italian keyboard layout, run the previous command adding</p>

<pre>  GAIA_KEYBOARD_LAYOUTS=en,es,it</pre>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">At this point  Gaia is ready to flash in the phone for the first time. Connect the phone and make sure Remote Debugging is checked in Settings &gt; Device Information &gt; More Information &gt; Developer.  You only need to do this once, for your own build of Gaia will have that pref turned on thanks to REMOTE_DEBUGGER=1:</span></p>

<pre> make clean &amp;&amp; make production LOCALES_FILE=locales/languages-own.json</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre> rm -rf out objdir-gecko &amp;&amp; LOCALES_FILE=locales/languages-dev.json ./build.sh</pre>

<div class="note">
<p>If you want to clone and/or update all supported locales for a particular branch, you can use <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dattaz/build-firefoxos/master/langs.sh">this script</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Building_a_blob_free_full_system_zip">Building a blob free full system zip</h3>

<p>You can build a blob-free system zip that can be used to convert a supporting already running Android device into a B2G OS device, solving the long standing problem of not being able to distribute builds because of their copyrighted blobs. We are enabling this on a device-by-device basis, with only the Flame and Z3/Z3 Compact phones being supported initially.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We should be able to extend this to any device we can already build for, but each instance will need checking before release.</p>
</div>

<p>Such a zip is built using the following option:</p>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" id="comment_text_14">./build.sh blobfree</pre>

<p>This produces a zip file composed of:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A distribution zip with all the partitions ready but not as image files (<code>BOOT</code>, <code>RECOVERY</code> and <code>SYSTEM</code> directories.)</li>
 <li>A <code>devices.json</code> file describing supported devices with adb properties and fastboot variables to read from and assert support in a live device.</li>
 <li>Recovery fstab, to allow partition &lt;-&gt; image mapping.</li>
 <li><code>dt.img</code> if required.</li>
 <li>Blob to system mapping, based on what is produced by <code>extract-files.sh</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The resulting zip is intended to be used with the B2G installer addon (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1166276" title="[meta] Getting a B2G Installer Addon">bug 1166276</a>.)</p>

</div>

<h3 id="Mountain_Lion-specific_build_errors">Mountain Lion-specific build errors</h3>

<div>
<p>1. If you are building on OS X 10.8 &quot;Mountain Lion&quot; (Xcode 4.4.1 or later) and encounter the following error:</p>

<pre style="font-size: 14px;">external/qemu/android/skin/trackball.c:130:25: error: &apos;M_PI&apos; undeclared (first use in this function)</pre>
Edit the file: <code style="font-size: 14px;">B2G/external/qemu/Makefile.android</code> and add in line 78:

</pre>
</div>

<div>2. If you are on Mountain Lion and you receive an error during ./build.sh like:</div>

<div>
<pre>/System/Library/Frameworks/IOKit.framework/Headers/usb/USB.h:797:9: error: too many #pragma options align=reset</pre>

<p>Replace all instances of &apos;#pragma options align=reset&apos; with &apos;#pragma pack()&apos; inside /System/Library/Frameworks/IOKit.framework/Headers/usb/USB.h</p>

<h3 id="Undefined_symbols__sqlite3_androidopt_handle_pragma_and__sqlite3_androidopt_open">Undefined symbols &quot;_sqlite3_androidopt_handle_pragma&quot; and &quot;_sqlite3_androidopt_open&quot;</h3>

<p>This error appears if you are building on OS X 10.7 or newer with Xcode 4.5 or something newer. To fix this, apply the patch at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/android-building/yAfPyUqCsiQ/7zvICk4GWjYJ">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/android-building/yAfPyUqCsiQ/7zvICk4GWjYJ</a> to the external/sqlite/dist/Android.mk file.</p>

<p>This error appears when your gcc version is too recent, although this should no longer be an issue since we upgraded our build system to use newer GCC. If you need to set the build system to use an older GCC, you can do so: see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Customization_with_the_.userconfig_file" title="Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Customization_with_the_.userconfig_file">Customizing with the .userconfig file</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="arm-linux-androideabi-g_Internal_error_Killed_(program_cc1plus)">arm-linux-androideabi-g++: Internal error: Killed (program cc1plus)</h3>

<p>If you see this message, it most likely means that free memory is lacking. Ensure there is enough free memory before running <code>./build.sh</code>. It should run fine if your system has 4GB of RAM.</p>

<h3 id="...is_referenced_by_DSO_error">&quot;...is referenced by DSO&quot; error</h3>

<p>While building the emulator, if you get /usr/bin/ld: out/host/linux-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/triangleCM_intermediates/triangleCM: hidden symbol `_XGetRequest&apos; in out/host/linux-x86/obj/STATIC_LIBRARIES/libSDL_intermediates/libSDL.a(SDL_x11dyn.o) is referenced by DSO.</p>

<p>You can get this with some versions in binutils. If you run Debian Stable, you can use the <em>gold</em> linker by installing the package <code>binutils-gold</code>. Note that the <em>gold</em> linker is already installed by <code>binutils</code>, but it&apos;s not used by default; <code>binutils-gold</code> does just that.</p>

<h3 id="error_device_not_found">error: device not found</h3>

<p>If you the message &quot;error: device not found&quot; at the beginning of ./build.sh, for example as part of this error:</p>

<pre>Blob setup script has changed, re-running
Backing up system partition to backup-flame
error: device not found
Pulling files from ../../../backup-flame
cat: ../../../backup-flame/system/build.prop: No such file or directory
cat: ../../../backup-flame/system/build.prop: No such file or directory
Invalid system backup - Wrong base version found.

Do this:
1. Delete backup-flame
2. Flash your device with KK based images from the vendor
3. Try building again

&gt; Build failed! &lt;</pre>

<p>In that case you need to make sure that your device is accessible with adb, so that it shows up when you run <code>adb devices</code>. Your device has to be connected, adb debugging needs to be enabled in the developer menu, and you may need to turn off screen locking so that the device is accessible even when it&apos;s locked. This is done by unchecking &quot;Lock Screen&quot; in the &quot;Screen Lock&quot; section in the  Settings app.</p>

<h3 id="If_you_get_build_errors_while_the_build_system_is_running_tests">If you get build errors while the build system is running tests</h3>

<p>Sometimes (especially after build tool or operating system updates) you&apos;ll get weird errors like this when the build system runs its post-build tests:</p>

<pre>Generating permissions.sqlite...
test -d profile || mkdir -p profile
run-js-command  permissions
WARNING: permission unknown:offline-app
WARNING: permission unknown:indexedDB-unlimited
build/permissions.js:122: NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED: Component returned failure code: 0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED) [nsIPermissionManager.add]
make[1]: *** [permissions] Error 3
make: *** [gaia/profile.tar.gz] Error 2</pre>

<p>In this situation, try deleting the <code>gaia/xulrunner-sdk</code> directory and re-pulling the code:</p>

<pre>rm -r gaia/xulrunner-sdk
</pre>

<p>This deletes the downloaded, precompiled copy of <a href="/en-US/docs/XULRunner" title="/en-US/docs/XULRunner">XULRunner</a> that the build system retrieves automatically; on your next build, a new copy of XULRunner will be automatically retrieved.</p>

<h3 id="Cannot_fetch_platformlibcore">Cannot fetch platform/libcore</h3>

<p>If you tried to configure your B2G build for Nexus S (<code>./config.sh nexus-s</code>) and got an error related to libcore, it is because of a problem with the linaro git that feeds into this. To fix this, checkout the B2G manifest like so:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">git clone https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/b2g-manifest.git</pre>

<p>Edit the <code>nexus-s.xml</code> file in this repo, replacing the linaro git entry with a reference to the aosp entry, which should read like so:</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">&lt;default revision=&quot;refs/tags/android-4.0.4_r1.2&quot;
              remote=&quot;aosp&quot;
              sync-j=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;</pre>

<p>Commit these changes (<code>git commit -a</code>) and then change the <code>config.sh</code> file in the master branch of the main B2G repo that you checked out to point to your modified local manifest instead of the Mozilla one:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">GITREPO=${GITREPO:-&quot;file:///home/path/to/my/b2g-manifest&quot;}</pre>

<h3 id="clang_errors_when_building_with_Xcode_5_on_Mac">clang errors when building with Xcode 5 on Mac</h3>

<p>If you are building on Mac OS X 10.8 with Xcode 5, you may see errors like the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">clang: error: argument unused during compilation: &apos;-include system/core/include/arch/darwin-x86/AndroidConfig.h&apos;
clang: error: argument unused during compilation: &apos;-U DEBUG&apos;
clang: error: argument unused during compilation: &apos;-U DEBUG&apos;
clang: error: argument unused during compilation: &apos;-MF out/host/darwin-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/obbtool_intermediates/Main.d&apos;
make: *** [out/host/darwin-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/obbtool_intermediates/Main.o] Error 1</pre>

<p>This is because Xcode 5 changes the g++ compiler in <code>/usr/bin</code>, which breaks the build process if you try to use it to compile. In order to work around the problem, edit the following line in <code>build/core/combo/HOST_darwin-x86.mk:</code></p>

<pre class="brush: bash">HOST_CXX := g++</pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">HOST_CXX := g++-4.7
ifeq (,$(wildcard /usr/local/bin/g++-4.7))
 HOST_CXX := g++
endif</pre>

<p>Next, you have  to uninstall gcc, using brew (this assumes you&apos;ve run the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites#Run_Firefox_OS_Mac_Bootstrap">Mac OS bootstrap script</a> — if not, you&apos;ll need to complete that step before continuing):</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">brew uninstall gcc-4.7</pre>

<p>Now reinstall gcc with multilib and c++ support:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">brew install --enable-cxx https://gist.github.com/artlogic/6988658/raw/aeb9d1ea098274ad3f3fe2637b9df7f308a8a120/gcc-4.7.rb</pre>

<p>Make sure /usr/local/bin is on your PATH. You can do this temporarily by typing the following into the command prompt:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH</pre>

<p>You can make the above change permanent by adding it to the <code>.bash_profile</code> file in your home directory.</p>

<p>After you&apos;ve set your PATH, make sure you can run both of the following commands:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">gcc-4.7 -v

g++-4.7 -v</pre>

<p>If either of these commands fail, you may need to relink your GCC using brew with the following command:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">brew link --overwrite gcc-4.7</pre>

<p>It&apos;s also possible that <code>/usr/bin/c++</code> is not pointing at clang++ as it should be with Xcode 5 installed. You can determine if it is by typing the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">ls -l /usr/bin/c++</pre>

<p>It should return something that looks like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">lrwxr-xr-x 1 root admin 7 Sep 19 11:40 /usr/bin/c++ -&gt; clang++
</pre>

<p>If c++ is pointing at something other than clang++, update it with the following commands:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">sudo rm /usr/bin/c++

sudo ln -s /usr/bin/clang++ /usr/bin/c++</pre>

<h3 id="systemcoreincludeloglog.h3820_error_stdarg.h_No_such_file_or_directory">&quot;system/core/include/log/log.h:38:20: error: stdarg.h: No such file or directory&quot;</h3>

<p>This can occur if you are using the 10.6 SDK to build on Mac OSX 10.10, or some other SDK configuration that is not supported on the build config you are trying to build. See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1071266" title="FIXED: [flame] XCode 6 only provides 10.9 SDK causing flame builds to fail">bug 1071266</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="cp_cannot_stat_&apos;......backup-flamesystemliblibalsa-intf.so&apos;_No_such_file_or_directory">cp: cannot stat &apos;../../../backup-flame/system/lib/libalsa-intf.so&apos;: No such file or directory</h3>

<p>The symptom here is that the build system is trying to use a file from your backup directory, but this file is missing. Such issues can have several causes.</p>

<ol>
 <li>The USB connection is broken while the script pulls data from device to computer.</li>
 <li>You&apos;re building for the wrong target (wrong device or wrong underlying Android version).</li>
 <li>You don&apos;t have the base build the script expects.</li>
</ol>

<p>We&apos;ll explore these causes in more detail in the below subsections.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The backup directory is a copy of some files from your target device so that the build system can produce a full image, including binary files that we don&apos;t have the source for. Usually we can&apos;t distribute these files — that&apos;s why you need to fetch them from an existing device containing a base build obtained from the vendor.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="The_USB_connection_is_broken_while_pulling_data">The USB connection is broken while pulling data</h4>

<p>When building, if the backup directory doesn&apos;t exist, the script will automatically start fetching the files from your attached device. At the end of this process you should see lines similar to the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">143 files pulled. 0 files skipped.
3003 KB/s (512036044 bytes in 30.662s)</pre>

<p>If you see pulling messages from adb (lines starting with <code>pull</code>) but don&apos;t see this, this means the connection was broken before completion. In this case you should delete your backup directory and try building again.</p>

<p>Note: Some base builds will disable adb when the phone is locked. If that&apos;s the case for you, you&apos;ll need to disable screenlock so that it doesn&apos;t lock itself.</p>

<h4 id="You&apos;re_building_for_the_wrong_target">You&apos;re building for the wrong target</h4>

<p>The target is the parameter you gave to the config.sh script in the previous step. To check your configured target, just run:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">$ cat .config</pre>

<p>And you should get an output like the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">...
DEVICE_NAME=flame-kk
PRODUCT_NAME=flame</pre>

<p>The <code>DEVICE_NAME</code> is what you&apos;re looking for. For example, current <code>flame</code> builds should use <code>flame-kk</code>, not <code>flame</code>.</p>

<p>If the <code>DEVICE_NAME</code> is wrong, then you need to <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Preparing_for_your_first_B2G_build">reconfigure using config.sh</a>, delete your current backup directory (<code>backup-flame</code> for the flame), and rerun the build script.</p>

<h3 id="Emulator_build_issues"><strong>Emulator build issues</strong></h3>

<p>If you are making an <strong>emulator</strong> build, you need to pay attention to these issues:</p>

<div class="warning notecard">
<p><strong>Important</strong>: You shouldn&apos;t use the x86 emulator — it is hard to install and not well supported.</p>
</div>

<p>The build-system for the emulator builds both 32bit and 64bit versions of the emulator. As the emulator depends on OpenGL, this means that you need to have both 32bit and 64bit versions of OpenGL libraries installed on your system. See the discussion in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=897727" title="B2G emulator build requires both 32-bit and 64-bit libgl, but Debian&apos;s libgl1-mesa-dev package is not multilib compatible">bug 897727</a>.</p>

<p>There are two ways that you can solve this problem:</p>

<h4 id="Solution_1_have_both_32_bit_and_64_bit_OpenGL_libs_installed_with_the_right_symlinks">Solution #1: have both 32 bit and 64 bit OpenGL libs installed, with the right symlinks</h4>

<p>If your Linux distro has <code>multilib</code> packages for OpenGL libraries, you can attempt to install them. You might then have to manually create some symlinks.</p>

<p>For example, here is the situation for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x86-64. On this distribution, the <code>libgl1-mesa-dev</code> package cannot be installed simultaneously in x86-64 and i386 versions, but you can have the following combination of packages simultaneously installed:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash" id="comment_text_12">sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libglapi-mesa:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386</pre>

<p>After having run this command, you will still have to manually create some symlinks for the emulator build to succeed:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libX11.so.6 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libX11.so
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libGL.so</pre>

<h4 id="Solution_2_just_patch_the_emulator_so_it_only_builds_64_bit">Solution #2: just patch the emulator so it only builds 64 bit</h4>

<p>Just apply <a href="https://bug897727.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=786280" title="https://bug897727.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=786280">this patch</a> to the <code>sdk/</code> Git repository found under the B2G repo. This will cause the B2G emulator to only attempt to build the 64 bit emulator if you&apos;re on a 64 bit system, thus avoiding any multilib issues. The 32 bit emulator is unused on a 64 bit system. This is the simplest solution, until this patch eventually bit-rots.</p>

<p><span class="message"><span class="content">For Ubuntu you can compile an older version by <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/make">downloading this version</a></span></span></p>

<p>Install using the following:</p>

<p>After building, your next step depends on whether you built Boot to Gecko for the emulator or for a real mobile device; see the following articles for details:</p>

<h3 id="Submitting_bugs_on_B2GB2G_OSGaia">Submitting bugs on B2G/B2G OS/Gaia</h3>

<p>Once you&apos;ve got a B2G/B2G OS build running, you&apos;ll probably want to start to file bugs against this specific version, so the B2G OS community can improve things as effectively as possible. You&apos;ll want to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox%20OS">file the bug on Bugzilla</a>, under the &quot;B2G OS&quot; project, but you should include version specifics:</p>

<ol>
 <li>To start with, tell us the major version number, e.g. <em>1.4.0.0-prerelease</em>. This can be found on the device under <em>Settings &gt; Device Information</em>.</li>
 <li>You can provide more specific version identifiers by  returning the current hashes from the gaia and gecko repositories. This can be done like so:
  <pre class="brush: bash">#!/bin/bash
(cd gaia;  echo &quot;gaia  $(git rev-parse HEAD)&quot;)
(cd gecko; echo &quot;gecko $(git rev-parse HEAD)&quot;)</pre>
 </li>
</ol>
