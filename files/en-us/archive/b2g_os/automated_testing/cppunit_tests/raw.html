<p><span class="seoSummary">Cppunit tests are headless Gecko C++ unit tests. You can run Cppunit tests on B2G; in this article we will look at how to do so. Currently, these are mainly tested on the emulator, but theoretically , it should run on devices as well. </span></p>

<h2 id="The_Hard_Way">The Hard Way</h2>

<p>There isn't currently much command to run the cpp unit tests, so we're stuck running them the "hard way".</p>

<h3 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
 <li>You need to build B2G for the target you're testing (see: <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Building_and_installing_Firefox_OS" title="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Building_and_installing_Firefox_OS">Building and installing Firefox OS</a>). Currently, only emulator builds are supported, though other devices may also work.</li>
 <li>You need to install some Python packages, either in a virtualenv or otherwise:
  <pre>cd $GECKO_DIR/testing/mozbase
python setup_development.py
cd $GECKO_DIR/testing/marionette/client
python setup.py develop
</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Either make sure that <code>adb</code> is on your path or specify it with <code>--adbpath</code> (on Linux it is found at <code>$B2G_HOME/out/host/linux-x86/bin/adb</code><em>.</em>)</li>
 <li>Have a local copy of <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/latest/busybox-armv6l">Busybox</a> (this isn't strictly necessary but greatly reduces the required setup time).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Running_the_tests">Running the tests</h3>

<p>You can then run xpcshell tests by first starting on an emulator and then executing the following commands:</p>

<pre>cd $B2G_HOME/objdir-gecko
make package-tests
cd dist/test-stage/cppunittests
python remotecppunittests.py --xre-path $B2G_HOME/objdir-gecko/dist/bin --adbpath $ADB_PATH --dm_trans=adb --addEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib:/system/lib:/system/b2g &lt;test1&gt; &lt;test2&gt; ...</pre>
