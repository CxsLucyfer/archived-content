<p class="summary">The WebBluetooth API is a Firefox OS-only API created to allow control of a device's low-level Bluetooth functionality via JavaScript. This article explains the basics of how to use the API in a Firefox OS app.</p>

<h2 id="Permissions">Permissions</h2>

<p>Certified/internal applications that want to use the Web Bluetooth API must request the relevant permission within their app manifest.</p>

<pre class="brush: json">"permission": {
  "bluetooth":{}
}</pre>

<p>It is also recommended to ask for the <code>settings</code> permission, because currently, enabling and disabling Bluetooth has to be done by changing the value of a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/mozSettings" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.mozSettings</code></a> setting named "bluetooth.enabled". The code to accomplish this would look something like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var lock = navigator.mozSettings.createLock();
var lockCompleteReq = lock.set({
  'bluetooth.enabled': true
});

result.onsuccess = function() {
  /* do what you need to do now that Bluetooth is on */
}

result.onerror = function() {
  /* deal with the error; Bluetooth was not enabled successfully */
}
</pre>

<h2 id="Pairing_Bluetooth_devices">Pairing Bluetooth devices</h2>

<p>The most important step when dealing with a Bluetooth environment is pairing devices to build a secure Bluetooth micro-network. Pairing is a procedure by which two Bluetooth devices come to share a common "key", called the "Link Key". After two devices have been paired, it is possible to set up more advanced connections, using profiles to access specific features of the devices.</p>

<p>The pairing procedure depends on the I/O capabilities of each device.</p>

<p>Each time a remote device wants to be paired with a Firefox OS device, a system message called <code>bluetooth-pairing-request</code> is sent. To intercept that system message, the application in charge of handling the pairing must register the message within its application manifest:</p>

<pre class="brush: json">"messages": [
  { "bluetooth-pairing-request": "/pairing.html" }
]</pre>

<p>It must also register a message handler for that message:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">navigator.mozSetMessageHandler("bluetooth-pairing-request", function (message) {
  // Get the information about the pairing request
  var request = message.detail;

  // Handle the pairing request. For this simple example, we're just logging
  // the name of the remote device that wants to be paired with your device

  console.log(request.name);
});</pre>

<p>The message's <code>detail</code> property contains all the information needed to start pairing the two devices:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>address</code>: The address of the remote device on the Bluetooth micro-network (see: <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BluetoothDevice/address" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>BluetoothDevice.address</code></a>).</li>
 <li><code>name   </code>: The name of the remote device (see: <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BluetoothDevice/name" title="The BluetoothDevice.name read-only property returns a DOMString that provides a human-readable name for the device."><code>BluetoothDevice.name</code></a>).</li>
 <li><code>icon   </code>: An icon name to use (see: <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BluetoothDevice/icon" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>BluetoothDevice.icon</code></a>).</li>
 <li><code>passkey</code>: A pass key the user has to type if the remote device is an input device.</li>
 <li><code>method </code>: The pairing method to use, one of <code>confirmation</code>, <code>pincode</code> or <code>passkey</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finalizing the pairing request depends on the specified <code>method</code>. Each method provides a mechanism for ensuring that both devices are controlled by the same user, to prevent unauthorized usage.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>confirmation</code></dt>
 <dd>Both devices display a 6-digit number on their screens; the user must confirm that both devices show the same number to initiate the connection.</dd>
 <dt><code>pincode</code></dt>
 <dd>The remote device does not have a screen (for example, it might be a headset or a mouse). The device's manufacturer provides a PIN code which must be entered on the other device to complete pairing.</dd>
 <dt><code>passkey</code></dt>
 <dd>If the remote device is a text input device (such as a keyboard), a 6-digit number may be shown, and the user must enter the key using that remote device.</dd>
</dl>

<p>So an application managing pairing must handle three different pairing methods. To send the user answer to the remote device, the Bluetooth API provides the following methods: <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BluetoothAdapter/setPairingConfirmation" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>BluetoothAdapter.setPairingConfirmation()</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BluetoothAdapter/setPinCode" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>BluetoothAdapter.setPinCode()</code></a>, and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BluetoothAdapter/setPasskey" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>BluetoothAdapter.setPasskey()</code></a></p>

<pre class="brush: js">var adapter;

// Retreving the local device adapter is asynchronous, handle this carefully.
navigator.mozBluetooth.getDefaultAdapter().success = function(evt) {
  adapter = evt.target.result;
}

function onPairing(message) {
  var reponse,
      request = message.detail,
      passkey = request.passkey;

  switch (request.method) {
    case 'confirmation':
      // Make sure the passkey is a string
      passkey = String(passkey);
      // Make sure the string is 6 characters long (pad with 0 if necessary)
      passkey = (new Array((6 - passkey.length) + 1)).join('0') + passkey;
      // Let's prompt the user
      response = confirm('Is that same number visible on the remote device screen: ' + passkey)
      // Let's send the confirmation
      adapter.setPairingConfirmation(request.address, response);
      break;

    case 'pincode':
      // Let's prompt the user
      response = prompt('Thanks to provide the remote device PIN code');
      // Let's send the pin code
      adapter.setPinCode(request.address, response);
      break;

    case 'passkey':
      // Let's prompt the user
      response = alert('Thanks to type the following code on the remote device');
      // Let's send back the passkey
      adapter.setPasskey(request.address, response);
      break;
  }
}

navigator.mozSetMessageHandler("bluetooth-pairing-request", onPairing);
</pre>

<p>When the pairing operation is complete on both sides, the application is notified of the success or failure of the operation through the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/pairedstatuschanged" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/pairedstatuschanged">pairedstatuschanged</a></code> event where the callback handler is getting a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BluetoothStatusChangedEvent" title="The BluetoothStatusChangedEvent API provides access to information regarding any change to the status of a Bluetooth device."><code>BluetoothStatusChangedEvent</code></a>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">adapter.onpairedstatuschanged = function (evt) {
  if (evt.status) {
    alert("The pairing operation has been successfully completed");
  } else {
    alert("The pairing operation has failed. Please, try again");
  }
}</pre>
