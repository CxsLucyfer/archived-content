<p>If you are a native mobile platform developer, why should you look into developing open web apps? This article talks you through open web app advantages, and the basic steps required to create one.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Advantages">Advantages</h2>

<p>For mobile application developers, the open web apps project offers these advantages:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Develop on a single technology stack (HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) and deliver across all platforms, from smartphones to tablets to desktops.</li>
 <li><strong>Standards</strong>: The technology stack is defined by standards bodies (W3C and Ecma) that operate in the open, rather than by particular technology or platform vendors.</li>
 <li><strong>Freedom</strong>: You're not locked in to a vendor-controlled ecosystem. You can distribute your app through the Firefox Marketplace, your own website, or any other store based on Mozilla's open app store technology.</li>
 <li><strong>Reach</strong>: You have the potential to reach Firefox's 450 million desktop users, as well as users of other desktop browsers and mobile users.</li>
</ul>

 <dt>1. Develop your app using open Web technologies.</dt>
 <dd>You probably already know at least a bit about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The <a href="/en-US/learn">Learn</a> section of this website has resources to help you ramp up even more. As a mobile app developer, you already have a <a class="external" href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">Mobile First</a> approach to Web design.</dd>
 <dt>2. Add an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Manifest">app manifest</a>.</dt>
 <dd>All that inherently separates a Web app from a normal website is a single, JSON-format text file.</dd>
 <dt>3. Publish the app, either on your own site or in an app store (or both).</dt>
 <dd>Publishing it yourself requires <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/JavaScript_API">adding some code to your site to manage installing and updating the app</a> in users' browsers.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Optional_features">Optional features</h2>

<p></p><p><em>Philosophically</em>, the idea of an installable Open Web app is much more than simply adding a manifest to your site. Web standards technologies can be viewed as a full-blown application platform that happens to use a browser engine for rendering user interfaces and interpreting code, and happens to use Web protocols for communicating with a server. Mozilla offers "<a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Architecture#Web_runtime">Web runtime</a>" executables for various platforms so that apps can run in their own window, without a browser window frame.</p>

<p>To "appify" a website, there are many application-specific questions to consider:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Should my app work when not connected to the Web?</li>
 <li>How does my app use data, and how does it need to be stored?</li>
 <li>Can my app's performance benefit from advanced platform features like <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers">Web Workers</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/WebSockets">WebSockets</a>?</li>
 <li>And many more</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to take full advantage of the capabilities of installable apps, there is plenty that you can do. For example:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Use <a href="/en-US/docs/Web_Development/Responsive_Web_design">responsive Web design</a> to look good and work well on all devices.</li>
 <li>Charge money for apps.</li>
 <li>Provide a way to <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Identity_integration">identify users</a>.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Offline_apps">Enable offline caching</a> so the app can be used when the device is not on the Internet.</li>
 <li>Store data locally using either <a href="/en-US/docs/IndexedDB">IndexedDB</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Storage">localStorage</a>.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Platform-specific_details">Launch the app</a> natively (with an icon on the desktop or the home screen).</li>
 <li>Use device APIs to interact with hardware, such as <a href="/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Using_geolocation">geolocation</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Orientation_and_motion_data_explained">orientation</a>.</li>
 <li>Give users a way to give you feedback. Mozilla's user research shows that users want to give feedback to app developers, and want to know that there is a human receiving it. They want to make suggestions and get help with problems. They may stop using an app if they have a problem and there is no way to get help with it.</li>
</ul><p></p>
