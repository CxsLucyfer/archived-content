<p>If you are a Web developer and you have a website or web application that you would like to make into an installable open web app, there is <em>technically</em> very little that you need to do. This article runs through minimum requirements, along with the ideas to take on board about open web apps, and how they differ from standard web sites.</p>
</div>

<p>The minimum requirements are few:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Manifest">app manifest</a>.</li>
 <li>Serve the app manifest in a file with a file extension of <code>.webapp</code>. Set the <code>Content-Type</code> header to <code>application/x-web-app-manifest+json</code>.</li>
 <li>Publish the app, either on your own site or in an app store (or both). Publishing it yourself requires <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/JavaScript_API">adding some code to your site to manage installing and updating the app</a> in users' browsers.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Optional_features">Optional features</h2>

<p><em>Philosophically</em>, the idea of an installable Open Web app is much more than simply adding a manifest to your site. Web standards technologies can be viewed as a full-blown application platform that happens to use a browser engine for rendering user interfaces and interpreting code, and happens to use Web protocols for communicating with a server. Mozilla offers "<a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Architecture#Web_runtime">Web runtime</a>" executables for various platforms so that apps can run in their own window, without a browser window frame.</p>

<p>To "appify" a website, there are many application-specific questions to consider:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Should my app work when not connected to the Web?</li>
 <li>How does my app use data, and how does it need to be stored?</li>
 <li>Can my app's performance benefit from advanced platform features like <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers">Web Workers</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/WebSockets">WebSockets</a>?</li>
 <li>And many more</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to take full advantage of the capabilities of installable apps, there is plenty that you can do. For example:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Use <a href="/en-US/docs/Web_Development/Responsive_Web_design">responsive Web design</a> to look good and work well on all devices.</li>
 <li>Charge money for apps.</li>
 <li>Provide a way to <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Identity_integration">identify users</a>.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Offline_apps">Enable offline caching</a> so the app can be used when the device is not on the Internet.</li>
 <li>Store data locally using either <a href="/en-US/docs/IndexedDB">IndexedDB</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Storage">localStorage</a>.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Platform-specific_details">Launch the app</a> natively (with an icon on the desktop or the home screen).</li>
 <li>Use device APIs to interact with hardware, such as <a href="/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Using_geolocation">geolocation</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Orientation_and_motion_data_explained">orientation</a>.</li>
 <li>Give users a way to give you feedback. Mozilla's user research shows that users want to give feedback to app developers, and want to know that there is a human receiving it. They want to make suggestions and get help with problems. They may stop using an app if they have a problem and there is no way to get help with it.</li>
</ul>
