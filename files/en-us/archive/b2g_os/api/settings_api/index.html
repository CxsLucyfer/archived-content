      This feature is not on a current W3C standards track, but it is supported on the Firefox OS platform. Although implementations may change in the future and it is not supported widely across browsers, it is suitable for use in code dedicated to Firefox OS apps.</p>
      </div><p></p>

<p></p><div class="warning">
    <p style="text-align: center;">This API is available on <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a> for <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Security/Application_security#App_Types">internal applications</a> only.</p>

<p class="summary">The <strong>Settings API</strong> is a way to access, change, and monitor changes to any device&apos;s settings. Because device settings can contain a lot of sensitive information that can jeopardize the system, only certified applications can use this API.</p>

<h2 id="Using_settings">Using settings</h2>

<p>Settings can be manipulated through the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/mozSettings" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.mozSettings</code></a> object, which is an instance of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/SettingsManager" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>SettingsManager</code></a> interface.</p>

<h3 id="Accessing_settings">Accessing settings</h3>

<p>To access a setting, you first need to create a lock by calling the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/SettingsManager/createLock" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>createLock()</code></a> method. Because several applications can access and change a setting at the same time, this ensures that apps won&apos;t interfere with one another. To that end, by creating a lock, each application is sure that it will be the only application accessing the settings at that specific moment.</p>

<p>Once your application has a lock, it can read any setting by using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/SettingsLock/get" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>get()</code></a> method. This method returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object that will report the success or failure of the operation. In all cases, the lock will automatically be released to let other applications access the settings as soon as the request is completed (whether it&apos;s successful or not). If needed, you can check to see if the lock has been released using the lock&apos;s <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/SettingsLock/closed" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>closed</code></a> property.</p>

<p>In this code snippet, a lock is created and the value of the system&apos;s <code>wifi.enabled</code> setting is requested. The output is displayed to the console by calling <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log" title="Outputs a message to the Web Console."><code>console.log()</code></a>:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var lock    = navigator.mozSettings.createLock();
var setting = lock.get(&apos;wifi.enabled&apos;);

setting.onsuccess = function () {
  console.log(&apos;wifi.enabled: &apos; + setting.result);
}

setting.onerror = function () {
  console.warn(&apos;An error occured: &apos; + setting.error);
}
</pre>

<h3 id="Changing_settings">Changing settings</h3>

<p>The process of changing a setting&apos;s value is exactly the same as accessing it, except you call the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/SettingsLock/set" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>set()</code></a> method. This method returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object that lets you know if the setting change request succeeded or not.</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/SettingsLock/set" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>set()</code></a> expects an object as its input parameter. This object is a collection of key/value pairs in which each key is a setting name and its corresponding value is the new value for the setting. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Platform/Settings_list" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Platform/Settings_list">Firefox OS settings list</a> for a list of settings (but keep in mind that different devices may have variations on which settings are used).</p>

<p>Here we see a lock being created and the value of the <code>wifi.enabled</code> setting being retrieved and displayed on the console.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var lock = navigator.mozSettings.createLock();
var result = lock.set({
  &apos;wifi.enabled&apos;: true
});

result.onsuccess = function () {
  console.log(&quot;the settings has been changed&quot;);
}

result.onerror = function () {
  console.log(&quot;An error occure, the settings remain unchanged&quot;);
}</pre>

<h3 id="Listening_for_change_in_settings">Listening for change in settings</h3>

<p>Beyond reading and changing settings, applications can also listen for changes made to settings. Each time a setting is changed, the system triggers a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/settingchange" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/settingchange">settingchange</a></code> event. This event is a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSettingsEvent" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozSettingsEvent</code></a>, which is a regular event extended with two extra properties:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSettingsEvent/settingName" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>settingName</code></a>, which provides the name of the setting that has been changed.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSettingsEvent/settingValue" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>settingValue</code></a>, which provides the setting&apos;s new value.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/settingchange" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/settingchange">settingchange</a></code> event can be monitored by setting <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/SettingsManager/onsettingchange" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>SettingsManager.onsettingchange</code></a> to specify a callback which is called for every setting change. If you&apos;d rather listen for changes to a specific setting, you can call the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/SettingsManager/addObserver" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>SettingsManager.addObserver()</code></a> method to do so, as shown here:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function handleWifi(event) {
  if (event.settingValue === true) {
    console.log(&quot;Hey! I can download that crazy heavy 4GB file&quot;)
  } else {
    console.log(&quot;Oh! I should stop downloading that crazy 4GB file&quot;)
  }
}

navigator.mozSettings.addObserver(&apos;wifi.enabled&apos;, handleWifi);
</pre>

<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>

<p>Not part of any specification yet; however, this API will be discussed at W3C as part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/" class="external" rel="external" title="http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/">System Applications Working Group</a>.</p>
