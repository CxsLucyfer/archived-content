<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The WebFM API provides access to the device FM radio. It allows turning the radio on/off and switching among radio stations. This API is available through the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/mozFMRadio" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.mozFMRadio</code></a> property which is a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio</code></a> object.</p>

<h2 id="Turn_the_radio_onoff">Turn the radio on/off</h2>

<p>Basicaly, the radio is turn on with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/enable" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.enable()</code></a> method and turn off with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/disable" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.disable()</code></a> method.</p>

<p>Before turning the radio on, it's wise to check if an antenna is available (without an antena, the build-in radio will not be able to receive any signal). This information is available via the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/antennaAvailable" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.antennaAvailable</code></a> property. On mobile device, it's the headphone cable that is used as an antenna. Because it's possible to plug/unplugged that cable, the WebFM API will fire an <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/antennaavailablechange" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/antennaavailablechange">antennaavailablechange</a></code> event each time the availability of the antenna change.</p>

<p>To turn the radio on it's necessary to provide a frequency to listen. That frequency (in MHz) is a number pass to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/enable" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.enable()</code></a> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// The frequency of the radio station
// to listen express in MHz
var frequency = 99.1;
var radio = navigator.mozFMRadio;

if (radio.antennaAvailable) {
  radio.enable(frequency);
} else {
  alert("You need to plug your headphone");
}

radio.addEventListener('antennaavailablechange', function () {
  if (radio.antennaAvailable) {
    radio.enable(frequency);
  } else {
    radio.disable();
  }
})
</pre>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The audio is output through the <code>normal</code> audio channel available on the device.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Switching_among_frequency">Switching among frequency</h2>

<p>Switching from on frequency to another can be done manually or automatically. In any case, the current radio frequency listened to by the built-in radio is always available with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/frequency" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.frequency</code></a> property. That property is number representing the frequency in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz">MHz</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Manual_switch">Manual switch</h3>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/setFrequency" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.setFrequency()</code></a> method must be used to set a new frequency to listen. However, there are some constraints about the value that can be set. The method will return a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object to handle the success or error of the method call. The frequency must fulfill the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The frequency must be in the range defined by <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/frequencyLowerBound" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.frequencyLowerBound</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/frequencyUpperBound" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.frequencyUpperBound</code></a>. If the frequency is out of range, it will result in an error.</li>
 <li>The frequency must be stepped based on the value of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/channelWidth" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.channelWidth</code></a>. If it's not the case, the frequency will be rounded accordingly. For example, if 100MHz is a valid frequency and if <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/channelWidth" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>channelWidth</code></a> has the value 0.2, trying to set a frequency of 100.15 will result in a frequency set to 100.2.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="brush: js">var change = radio.setFrequency(frequency);

change.onerror = function () {
  var min = radio.frequencyLowerBound;
  var max = radio.frequencyUpperBound;
  console.warn('The frequency must be within the range [' + min + ',' + max + ']');
}

change.onsuccess = function () {
  console.log('The frequency has been set to ' + radio.frequency);
}
</pre>

<h3 id="Automated_seeking">Automated seeking</h3>

<p>The WebFM API also provides a convenient way to seek radio channels automatically. To that end, we can use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/seekUp" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.seekUp()</code></a> (to find a radio channel on a higher frequency than the current one) and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/seekDown" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.seekDown()</code></a> method. The former is used to find a radio channel with a higher frequency than the current one, and the latter for a radio channel with a lower frequency. Those methods return a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object to handle the success or error of each method call.</p>

<p>Both methods will circle back to higher or lower frequency once they reach the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/frequencyLowerBound" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>frequencyLowerBound</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/frequencyUpperBound" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>frequencyUpperBound</code></a> values. When they find a new radio channel, they change the current frequency and fire a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/frequencychange" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/frequencychange">frequencychange</a></code> event.</p>

<p>It's not possible to seek twice at the same time (e.g. it's not possible to seek up and down at the same time), trying to do so, will result in an error. But if necessary it's possible to stop seeking by calling the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FMRadio/cancelSeek" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FMRadio.cancelSeek()</code></a> method. This method will also return a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var radio   = navigator.mozFMRadio;
var seeking = false;
var UP      = document.querySelector("button.up");
var DOWN    = document.querySelector("button.down");

// When the frequency change, the seek
// functions automatically stop to seek.
radio.onfrequencychange = function () {
  seeking = false;
}

function seek(direction) {
  var cancel, search;

  // If the radio is already seeking
  // we will cancel the current search.
  if (seeking) {
    var cancel = radio.cancelSeek();
    cancel.onsuccess = function () {
      seeking = false;

      // Once the radio no longer seek,
      // we can try to seek as expected
      seek(direction);
    }

  // Let's seek up
  } else if (direction === 'up') {
    // Just to be sure that the radio is turned on
    if (!radio.enabled) {
      radio.enable(radio.frequencyLowerBound);
    }
    search = radio.seekUp();

  // Let's seek down

      seeking = true;
    };
    search.onerror = function () {

      seek(direction);
