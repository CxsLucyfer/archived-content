<div class="overheadIndicator nonStandard nonStandardHeader">
<p><strong>Non-standard</strong><br>
 This feature is not on a current W3C standards track, but it is supported on the Firefox OS platform. Although implementations may change in the future and it is not supported widely across browsers, it is suitable for use in code dedicated to Firefox OS apps.</p>
</div>

<div class="warning notecard">
<p style="text-align: center;">This API is available on <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a> for <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Security/Application_security#App_Types">privileged or certified applications</a> only.</p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>The Device Storage API is used to access the file system within a Web app. Accessing the file system can be highly sensitive, and for that reason this API is available for privileged apps only.</p>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Accessing device storage is slow due to a limitation at the physical level. In many cases it can be faster to use an <a href="/en-US/docs/IndexedDB" title="/en-US/docs/IndexedDB">IndexedDB</a> database to store files instead of physical device storage.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Accessing_device_storage">Accessing device storage</h2>

<p>This section explains what is needed to access device storage.</p>

<h3 id="Entry_point">Entry point</h3>

<p>It&apos;s possible to access storage areas by using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getDeviceStorage" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.getDeviceStorage()</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getDeviceStorages" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.getDeviceStorages()</code></a> methods:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getDeviceStorage"><code>navigator.getDeviceStorage()</code></a> accepts a string parameter representing the name of the default storage area to be accessed. The method returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage"><code>DeviceStorage</code></a> object, which is used to access the related storage area. It returns the storage area whose <code>.default</code> attribute is <code>true</code>. This is controlled by the user via <em>Settings App &gt; Media Storage &gt; Default media location</em>.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getDeviceStorages"><code>navigator.getDeviceStorages()</code></a> on the other hand accepts a string representing the name of the storage area to be accessed, and returns an <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Array</a></code> of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage"><code>DeviceStorage</code></a> objects, one per physical storage area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Firefox OS provides the following storage names:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>apps</code>: This storage area is used to store the user data needed by apps. As it is critical data, accessing this storage area requires some extra privileges (see below) and is available to certified applications only.</li>
 <li><code>music</code>: This is the storage area where music and sounds are stored.</li>
 <li><code>pictures</code>: This is the storage area where pictures are stored.</li>
 <li><code>sdcard</code>: This is the storage area that grants access to the device&apos;s SDCard. <code>sdcard</code> is also used as the name of the device&apos;s default internal storage, which is a bit unfortunate and potentially confusing; be aware.</li>
 <li><code>videos</code>: This is the storage area where videos are stored.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="brush: js">var pics = navigator.getDeviceStorage(&apos;pictures&apos;);</pre>

<h3 id="Accessing_different_storage_areas_with_navigator.getDeviceStorages()">Accessing different storage areas with navigator.getDeviceStorages()</h3>

<p>When using <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getDeviceStorages" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.getDeviceStorages()</code></a>, if there is more than one storage area then the internal one will be named for example <code>sdcard</code> and the physical storage area will be called something else (sometimes it&apos;s <code>extsdcard</code>, sometimes it&apos;s <code>sdcard1</code>). This varies by device manufacturer. The names of files on the <code>sdcard</code> storage area will be <code>/sdcard/path/filename</code>, and the names of files on the <code>sdcard1</code> storage area will be <code>/sdcard1/path/filename</code>, or whatever.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>/sdcard</code> and <code>/sdcard1</code> are storage names. Their actual mount points on the system are determined via <code>vold</code> and/or <code>/system/etc/volume.cfg</code> file.) DeviceStorage transparently maps the <code>storageName</code> into the actual <code>mountPoint</code> (so you don&apos;t need the mount point if you&apos;re just accessing the files through device storage).</p>

<p>If you want to determine the mount point to examine the filesystem from an adb shell, then you can determine the <code>vold</code> mount points by using the command <code>adb shell vdc volume list</code>  (this requires a root shell).</p>

<p>On the <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developer_phone_guide/Flame">Flame</a>, you&apos;ll see something like this:</p>

<p>110 0 sdcard /storage/sdcard 4<br>
 110 0 sdcard1 /storage/sdcard1 4<br>
 200 0 Volumes listed.</p>

<p>For volumes that aren&apos;t managed by <code>vold</code> (for example, the <code>sdcard</code> volume on a Nexus 4/5), the mount point is found in <code>/system/etc/volume.cfg</code>.</p>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In Gaia engineering builds there is a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/dev_apps/ds-test"><code>ds-test</code> app</a>, which is useful for device storage testing.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Device_storage_permissions">Device storage permissions</h3>

<p>To be able to use these storage areas, the application must declare them in its application manifest. For example, if the application wants to access the <code>sdcard</code> storage area, it must have the &quot;<code>device-storage:sdcard</code>&quot; permission in its manifest.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">&quot;permissions&quot;: {
  &quot;device-storage:videos&quot;:{ &quot;access&quot;: &quot;readonly&quot; },
  &quot;device-storage:pictures&quot;:{ &quot;access&quot;: &quot;readwrite&quot; }
}</pre>

<p>As mentioned above, using <code>device-storage:apps</code> also needs some extra permissions, in the form of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/App_permissions#webapps-manage">webapps-manage</a> permission, which allows access to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/JavaScript_API#Management_API"><code>navigator.mozApps.mgmt</code></a> API for managing installed open web apps.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">&quot;permissions&quot;: {
  &quot;device-storage:apps&quot;:{ &quot;access&quot;: &quot;readwrite&quot; },
  &quot;webapps-manage&quot;:{ }
}</pre>

<p>All of the <code>device-storage</code> name permissions are privileged level, except for <code>apps</code>, which is certified. <code>webapps-manage</code> is certified level.</p>

<h2 id="Using_a_storage">Using a storage</h2>

<p>Once an application gets access to a storage area, it&apos;s possible to add, get and remove files inside the area.</p>

<h3 id="Add_a_file">Add a file</h3>

<p>Adding a file is done using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/addNamed" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>addNamed</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/add" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>add</code></a> methods. The former allows to set an explicit name when storing a file while the latter creates a name automatically when the file is stored. Both methods are asynchronous and return a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object to handle the <code>success</code> or <code>error</code> of the operation. This is very important as writing and reading files on a physical support is a slow process.</p>

<p>Those two methods expect a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob" title="A Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs represent data that isn&apos;t necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The File interface is based on Blob, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user&apos;s system."><code>Blob</code></a> as their first parameter. This object will be turned into a file under the hood and stored. When creating a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob" title="A Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs represent data that isn&apos;t necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The File interface is based on Blob, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user&apos;s system."><code>Blob</code></a> object, it&apos;s mandatory to give it a <code>type</code>. This <code>type</code>, which is a MIME type, is important because some storage areas have restrictions based on the type:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>music</code> only accepts <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob"><code>Blob</code></a> with a valid audio MIME type</li>
 <li><code>pictures</code> only accepts <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob"><code>Blob</code></a> with a valid image MIME type</li>
 <li><code>videos</code> only accepts <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob"><code>Blob</code></a> with a valid video MIME type</li>
</ul>

<pre class="brush: js">var sdcard = navigator.getDeviceStorage(&quot;sdcard&quot;);
var file   = new Blob([&quot;This is a text file.&quot;], {type: &quot;text/plain&quot;});

var request = sdcard.addNamed(file, &quot;my-file.txt&quot;);

request.onsuccess = function () {
  var name = this.result;
  console.log(&apos;File &quot;&apos; + name + &apos;&quot; successfully wrote on the sdcard storage area&apos;);
}

// An error typically occur if a file with the same name already exist
request.onerror = function () {
  console.warn(&apos;Unable to write the file: &apos; + this.error);
}
</pre>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Repositories in a storage area are implicit. It&apos;s not possible to create explicitly an empty repository. If you want to use a repository structure you have to make it part of the name of the file to store. So if you want to store the file <code>bar</code> inside the <code>foo</code> repository, you have to use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/addNamed" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>addNamed</code></a> method with the complete path name of the file <code>addNamed(<em>blob</em>, &quot;foo/bar&quot;)</code>. This is also true when you want to retrieve a file using its name (see below).</p>

<p>As files are added in a given restricted storage area for security reasons, a file path name cannot start with &quot;<code>/</code>&quot; nor &quot;<code>../</code>&quot; (and &quot;<code>./</code>&quot; is pointless).</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Get_a_file">Get a file</h3>

<p>Retrieving a file can be done in two ways: by using its name or by iterating the whole list of files.</p>

<p>The easiest way is to retrieve a file by its name using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/get" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>get</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/getEditable" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>getEditable</code></a> methods. The former provides a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/File" title="The File interface provides information about files and allows JavaScript in a web page to access their content."><code>File</code></a> object (which act like a read only file) when the latter provides a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileHandle" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FileHandle</code></a> object (which allows updating the underlaying file). Both methods are asynchronous and return a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object to handle the <code>success</code> or <code>error</code> of the operation.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var sdcard = navigator.getDeviceStorage(&apos;sdcard&apos;);

var request = sdcard.get(&quot;my-file.txt&quot;);

request.onsuccess = function () {
  var file = this.result;
  console.log(&quot;Get the file: &quot; + file.name);
}

request.onerror = function () {
  console.warn(&quot;Unable to get the file: &quot; + this.error);
}
</pre>

<p>The other way to retrieve files is by browsing the content of the storage area. This is possible using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/enumerate" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>enumerate</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/enumerateEditable" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>enumerateEditable</code></a> methods. The former provides <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/File" title="The File interface provides information about files and allows JavaScript in a web page to access their content."><code>File</code></a> objects when the latter provides <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileHandle" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>FileHandle</code></a> objects. Both methods are asynchronous and return a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMCursor" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMCursor</code></a> object to iterate along the list of files. A <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMCursor" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMCursor</code></a> is nothing less than a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> with extra power to iterate asynchronously along a list of things (files in that case).</p>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" id="comment_text_0">var pics = navigator.getDeviceStorage(&apos;pictures&apos;);

// Let&apos;s browse all the images available
var cursor = pics.enumerate();

cursor.onsuccess = function () {
  if(cursor.result.name !== null) {
    var file = cursor.result;
    console.log(&quot;File found: &quot; + file.name);

    // Once we found a file we check if there is other results
    // Then we move to the next result, which call the cursor
    // success with the next file as result.
      this.continue();
    }
}

cursor.onerror = function () {
    console.warn(&quot;No file found: &quot; + this.error);
}</pre>

<p>It&apos;s possible to limit the number of results by passing two optional parameters to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/enumerate" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>enumerate</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/enumerateEditable" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>enumerateEditable</code></a> methods.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The first parameter can be a string representing a sub folder to search inside.</li>
 <li>The second parameter can be an object with a <code>since</code> property, which allows you to limit the search to a given time period.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="brush: js">var pics = navigator.getDeviceStorage(&apos;pictures&apos;);

// Lets retrieve picture from the last week.
var param = {
  since: new Date((+new Date()) - 7*24*60*60*1000)
}

var cursor = pics.enumerate(param);

cursor.onsuccess = function () {
  var file = this.result;
  console.log(&quot;Picture taken on: &quot; + file.<code class="language-js">lastModifiedDate</code>);

  if (!this.done) {
    this.continue();
  }
}
</pre>

<h3 id="Delete_a_file">Delete a file</h3>

<p>A file can be removed from the storage area by simply using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/delete" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>delete</code></a> method. This method just needs the name of the file to delete. As all the other methods from the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DeviceStorage</code></a> interface, this one is also asynchronous and returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object to handle the <code>success</code> or <code>error</code> of the operation.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var sdcard = navigator.getDeviceStorage(&apos;sdcard&apos;);

var request = sdcard.delete(&quot;my-file.txt&quot;);

request.onsuccess = function () {
  console.log(&quot;File deleted&quot;);
}

request.onerror = function () {
  console.log(&quot;Unable to delete the file: &quot; + this.error);
}
</pre>

<h2 id="Storage_information">Storage information</h2>

<p>Beyond accessing files, a storage area provides a few methods to easily reach some important information</p>

<h3 id="Available_space">Available space</h3>

<p>One of the most important things to know when storing files on a device is the amount of space available. The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DeviceStorage</code></a> interface provides two useful functions dedicated to space:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/freeSpace"><code>freeSpace()</code></a> to get the amount of free space available to store new files;</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/freeSpace"><code>usedSpace()</code></a> to get the amount of space used to store the files;</li>
</ul>

<p>As those methods are asynchronous, they return a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> object to handle the <code>success</code> or <code>error</code> of the operation.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var videos = navigator.getDeviceStorage(&apos;videos&apos;);

var request = videos.usedSpace();

request.onsuccess = function () {
  // The result is express in bytes, lets turn it into megabytes
  var size = this.result / 1048576;
  console.log(&quot;The videos on your device use a total of &quot; + size.toFixed(2) + &quot;Mo of space.&quot;);
}

request.onerror = function () {
  console.warn(&quot;Unable to get the space used by videos: &quot; + this.error);
}
</pre>

<h3 id="Listening_for_change">Listening for change</h3>

<p>As many applications can use a same storage area at the same time, it&apos;s sometimes useful for an application to be aware of a change in that storage area. It&apos;s also useful for an application performing an asynchronous action because it doesn&apos;t have to relay on all the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRequest" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DOMRequest</code></a> objects returned by each method of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DeviceStorage</code></a> interface.</p>

<p>To that end, a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/change" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/change">change</a></code> event is triggered each time a file is created, modified or deleted. This event can be captured using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorage/onchange" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>onchange</code></a> property or the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" title="The EventTarget.addEventListener() method adds the specified EventListener-compatible object to the list of event listeners for the specified event type on the EventTarget on which it is called. The event target may be an Element in a document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest)."><code>addEventListener()</code></a> method. The event handler gets a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorageChangeEvent" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>DeviceStorageChangeEvent</code></a> object which is a regular <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event" title="The Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events."><code>Event</code></a> object with two extra properties:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorageChangeEvent/reason"><code>DeviceStorageChangeEvent.reason</code></a> which gives the reason of the change (<code>created</code>, <code>modified</code> or <code>deleted</code>).</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceStorageChangeEvent/path"><code>DeviceStorageChangeEvent.path</code></a> which gives the full path to the file affected by the change.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="brush: js">var sdcard = navigator.getDeviceStorage(&apos;sdcard&apos;);

sdcard.onchange = function (change) {
  var reason = change.reason;
  var path   = change.path;

  console.log(&apos;The file &quot;&apos; + path + &apos;&quot; has been &apos; + reason);
}
