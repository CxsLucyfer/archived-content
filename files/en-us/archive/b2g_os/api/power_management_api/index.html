<p class="summary">The <strong>Power Management API</strong> provides tools to manage a device's power <span lang="en" class="short_text" id="result_box"><span class="hps">consumption</span></span>.</p>

<h2 id="Managing_power">Managing power</h2>

<p>Managing power is something that is way beyond power itself: avoiding large computations, limiting reflow, etc. All of this is part of power management. However, the Power Management API really focuses on the direct power consumption (screen, cpu, etc.) The main interface to manage power is accessible through <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/mozPower" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.mozPower</code></a> which is an instance of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>PowerManager</code></a> interface.</p>

<h3 id="Basic_power_operations">Basic power operations</h3>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>PowerManager</code></a> interface allows to manage basic power operations.</p>

<h4 id="Global_power_operations">Global power operations</h4>

<p>It's possible to simply shut down the device with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager/powerOff" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>powerOff()</code></a> method or even reboot it with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager/reboot" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>reboot()</code></a> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">navigator.mozPower.powerOff();</pre>

<h4 id="Screen_power_operations">Screen power operations</h4>

<p>The screen can be turned off and on with the read/write property <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager/screenEnabled" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>screenEnabled</code></a>. But it's also possible to act by accessing and changing the screen brightness. It can be changed with the read/write property <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager/screenBrightness" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>screenBrightness</code></a>, which defines how bright the screen's backlight is, on a scale from 0 (very dim) to 1 (full brightness).</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// It doesn't make sense to change the brightness if the screen is off
if (navigator.mozPower.screenEnabled) {
  navigator.mozPower.screenBrightness = 0.5;
}</pre>

<h4 id="CPU_power_operations">CPU power operations</h4>

<p>Even if it's not possible to directly shut down the cpu, it's possible to tell if it can be shut down or not if the screen is turned off. This can be set with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager/cpuSleepAllowed" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>cpuSleepAllowed</code></a>. It determines if the device's CPU will sleep after the screen is disabled (<code>true</code>) or not (<code>false</code>); in this last case it will prevent the device from entering a suspended state.</p>

<h3 id="Advanced_power_operations">Advanced power operations</h3>

<p>Power management is better handled when the application in charge of the power can be notified about the needs of third party applications. For example, it is probably better if the screen does not turn off automatically after a few seconds while the user is watching a video.</p>

<h4 id="Request_wake_locks">Request wake locks</h4>

<p>Any application can request a wake lock. A wake lock is a way to ask one of the device's resources to <em>not</em> power itself off. A wake lock can be requested through the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/requestWakeLock" title="Navigator.requestWakeLock() method of the Wake Lock API is used to request a MozWakeLock on any resource of the device."><code>navigator.requestWakeLock()</code></a> method.</p>

<p>Wake locks are requested for specific resources that might be made unavailable for various reasons. For example, on a mobile device the power manager might decide to turn off the screen after a period of idle time to save power. The application that handles the ressource checks the lock state of a topic before turning off the associated resource. For example, a page could hold a lock on the <code>screen</code> topic to prevent the screensaver from appearing or the screen from turning off.</p>

<p>By default, Firefox OS allow <code>screen</code>, <code>cpu</code>, and <code>wifi</code> resources. But any application that handle a resource can define a resource name and set policy on its lock. For example, the resource manager might decide to ignore <code>screen</code> wake locks held by applications which are not visible.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var lock = navigator.requestWakeLock('screen');</pre>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/navigator/requestWakeLock" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>requestWakeLock</code></a> method returns an object containing a <code>topic</code> property, which represents the name of the resource with the lock, and an <code>unlock()</code> method that can be used to manully release the lock. Note that if the application is closed (really closed, not just idle) all the locks it requests will be released automatically.</p>

<h4 id="Handling_wake_lock">Handling wake lock</h4>

<p>Certified applications able to manage locks can be notified about change on the lock state. Actually, any application that wants to manage power should listen for lock state change on <code>screen</code> and <code>cpu</code>. This is done by using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager/addWakeLockListener" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>PowerManager.addWakeLockListener()</code></a> method (and it's possible to stop listening for lock requests by using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager/removeWakeLockListener" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>PowerManager.removeWakeLockListener()</code></a> method).</p>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PowerManager/addWakeLockListener" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>addWakeLockListener</code></a> method expects a callback function which must accept two parameters: a first string representing the resource to handle (in our case here, <code>screen</code> or <code>cpu</code>) and a second string representing the state of the lock.</p>

<p>A lock can be in three different states:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>unlocked</code></dt>
 <dd>Nobody holds the wake lock for the given resource.</dd>
 <dt><code>locked-foreground</code></dt>
 <dd>At least one application holds the wake lock and is visible.</dd>
 <dt><code>locked-background</code></dt>
 <dd>At least one application holds the wake lock, but all of them are hidden.</dd>
</dl>

<pre class="brush: js">// This is used to keep track of the last change on the lock state
var screenTimeout;

// A reference to the Power Manager
var power = window.navigator.mozPower;

// Here are the actions to handle based on the lock state
var powerAction = {

  // If there is no lock at all, we will suspend the device:
  // * Turn the screen off
  // * Allow the cpu to shut down
  unlocked: function suspendDevice() {
    power.cpuSleepAllowed = true;
    power.screenEnabled   = false;
  },

  // If there is a lock but the applications requesting it
  // are all in the background, we just turn the screen off
  'locked-background': function shutOffOnlyScreen() {
    power.cpuSleepAllowed = false;
    power.screenEnabled   = false;
  },

  // At last, if there is an active application that requests a lock,
  // actually there is nothing to do. That's the whole point.
}

function screenLockListener(topic, state) {
  // If the lock is not about the screen, there is nothing to do.
  if ('screen' !== topic) return;

  // Each time the lock changes state, we stop any pending power management operations
  window.clearTimeout(screenTimeout);

  // If there is an action defined for the given state
  if (powerAction[state]) {
    // We delay that action by 3s
    screenTimeout = window.setTimeout(powerAction[state], 3000);
  }
}

// We make sure our power management application is listening for any change on locks.
power.addWakeLockListener(screenLockListener);</pre>
