<p class="summary">The <strong>Idle API </strong>is used to notify an app when the user is idle. This lets an app take action when the user is doing nothing with theirÂ device. The most common use case is to save battery power; in this case, it is commonly used in conjuction with the <a href="/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Power_Management">Power Management API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Watching_for_an_idle_user">Watching for an idle user</h2>

<p>When an application wants to be notified when the system is idle, it must register an <strong>idle observer</strong>. An idle observer is an object that carries three properties:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A <code>time</code> property that defines the time, expressed in seconds, that must pass after the user's last action before the user is considered to be idle.</li>
 <li>An <code>onidle</code> property, which is a function called when the user is considered idle.</li>
 <li>An <code>onactive</code> property, which is a function called when the user becomes active after being idle.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Example_dimming_the_screen_when_the_user_is_idle">Example: dimming the screen when the user is idle</h3>

<p>In this example, an idle observer is set up that dims the screen's brightness to 50% when the user is idle for 10 seconds, and restores it back to 100% when the user is active again. A second observer is set up that turns off the screen when the user is idle for at least 15 seconds.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// NOTE: mozPower is part of the Power Management API

var fadeLight = {
  time: 10, // Ten seconds

  onidle: function () {
    // The user does not seem active, let's dim the screen down
    navigator.mozPower.screenBrightness = 0.5;
  },

  onactive: function () {
    // Ok, the user is back, let's brighten the screen up
    navigator.mozPower.screenBrightness = 1;
  }
}

var screenOff = {
  time: 15, // fifteen seconds

  onidle: function () {
    // Ok, the user had his chance but he's really idle, let's turn the screen off
    navigator.mozPower.screenEnabled = false;
  },

  onactive: function () {
    // Ok, the user is back, let's turn the screen on
    navigator.mozPower.screenEnabled = true;
  }
}

// Register the idle observers

navigator.addIdleObserver(fadeLight);
navigator.addIdleObserver(screenOff);
</pre>

<p>This code defines two idle observer objects: <code>fadeLight</code> and <code>screenOff</code>, then calls <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/addIdleObserver" title="This method is used to add an observer that will check if the user is idle and will act accordingly. Once an observer is added, it can be removed with Navigator.removeIdleObserver."><code>navigator.addIdleObserver()</code></a> once for each of them to register them with the system. Applications can set up as many idle observers as needed.</p>

<p>If the application no longer needs to watch for the user to become idle, it can remove idle observers by calling the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/removeIdleObserver" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.removeIdleObserver()</code></a> method, as seen below:</p>

<pre class="brush:js">navigator.removeIdleObserver(fadeLight);
navigator.removeIdleObserver(screenOff);
</pre>

<h2 id="Specification">Specification</h2>

<p>Not part of any specification yet; however, this API will be discussed at W3C as part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/" rel="external">System Applications Working Group</a>.</p>
