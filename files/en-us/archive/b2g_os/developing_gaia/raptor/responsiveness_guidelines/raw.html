<div class="summary">
<p><span class="seoSummary">The following tables of app startup stages and timings — and user stories — provide best practice guidelines for Firefox OS apps, in terms of "acceptable" app performance on all Firefox OS devices (including low-spec devices.) This forms the Firefox OS Performance team's UX-approved definition of performant apps, and is part of Mozilla's program for advancing Firefox OS responsiveness and perceived performance.</span></p>

<p>The following tables define different stages of app startup, and some time goals that you should aim for when trying to improve perceived app performance.

<h3 id="Implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>Using the following User Timing marks will show performance data in the <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Automated_testing/Raptor">Raptor</a> performance testing tool.</p>

<hr>
<pre>// navigationLoaded
performance.mark('navigationLoaded');</pre>

<p>Emit this marker when your application designates that its core chrome or navigation interface exists in the DOM and you have marked it as ready to be displayed, e.g. when the element is not <code>display: none;</code> or other hiding functionality.</p>

<hr>
<pre>// navigationInteractive
performance.mark('navigationInteractive');</pre>

<p>Emit this marker when your application designates that the core chrome or navigation interface has its events bound and is ready for user interaction.</p>

<hr>
<pre>// visuallyLoaded
performance.mark('visuallyLoaded');</pre>

<p>This marker maps to the important <strong><em>Content Visible</em></strong> marker above. Emit this when your application designates that it is visually loaded, e.g. the "above-the-fold" content exists in the DOM and you have marked it as ready to be display, again not <code>display: none;</code> or other hiding functionality.</p>

<hr>
<pre>// contentInteractive
performance.mark('contentInteractive');</pre>

<p>Emit this marker when your application designates that it has bound the events for the minimum set of functionality to allow the user to interact with the "above-the-fold" content made available at <code>visuallyLoaded</code>.</p>

<hr>
<pre>// fullyLoaded
performance.mark('fullyLoaded');</pre>

<p>Emit this mark when your application has been completely loaded, for example any relevant "below-the-fold" functionality has been injected into the DOM, been marked visible, and is ready for user interaction. Any required startup background processing should be complete and should exist in a stable state barring any further user interaction.</p>

<h2 id="User_stories">User stories</h2>

<p>The following user stories provide some insight into how users will perceive time and performance during app usage.</p>
