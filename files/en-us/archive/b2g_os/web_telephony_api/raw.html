<p>Web Telephony is an API that makes it possible for web content to handle voice phone calls using JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="Concepts_and_usage">Concepts and usage</h2>

<p>The Web Telephony API was created by Mozilla to satisfy the requirements for an API to control Firefox OS telephony capabilities. It is an internal-only API, because allowing 3rd party developers to gain control over such a critical device function is a major security concern.</p>

<p>The API's entry point is via the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/mozTelephony" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>Navigator.mozTelephony</code></a> property. This returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Telephony" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>Telephony</code></a> object that provides access to the device's telephony system, with methods and properties for controlling the microphone and speakerphone, generating dial tones (DTMF), starting and receiving calls, and more.</p>

<p>When a call is initiated, either started by the device using <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Telephony/dial" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>Telephony.dial()</code></a>, or received from elsewhere via the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Telephony/onincoming" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>Telephony.onincoming</code></a> handler, a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/TelephonyCall" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>TelephonyCall</code></a> object is created to represent the call. This can be manipulated via its properties and methods to allow programmatic answering, hanging up, and putting on hold of calls, responding to different call states, and much more.</p>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/TelephonyCallGroup" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>TelephonyCallGroup</code></a> interface is also available, for representing and controlling multi-person calls.</p>
