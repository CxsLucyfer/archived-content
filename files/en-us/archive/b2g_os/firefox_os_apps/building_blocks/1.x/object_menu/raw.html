<p>An object menu is a menu that lets the user directly manipulate objects without having to open them and navigate deeper into a view hierarchy.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Deleting a photo by selecting its thumbnail, instead of by opening the full image first.</li>
 <li>Flagging an email by selecting its preview instead of by first opening the email.</li>
 <li>Calling a contact by selecting their name, instead of by opening their detailed contact information then pressing a "Call" button.</li>
</ul>

<p>Object menus are currently implemented as a special case of action menu; this will evolve over time. For now, see the <a href="/en-US/Apps/Design/Firefox_OS_building_blocks/1.x/Action_menu/Coding" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks/Action_menu/Coding">action menu coding guide</a> for information on how to implement an object menu.</p>

<h2 id="Characteristics">Characteristics</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Object menus are accessed using a "press-and-hold" gesture on a selectable object, such as a list row, phone number, URL, or the like.</li>
 <li>An object menu contains one or more items.</li>
 <li>Object menus expand in height to accomodate their contents, to a maximum of the height of the screen; at that point, the contents of the menu scroll. As a rule of thumb, you should try to avoid having more than five items in the menu.</li>
 <li>Unlike <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks/Action_menu" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks/Action_menu">action menus</a>, object menus do not have titles.</li>
 <li>You implement object menus using the same <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks/Action_menu/Coding" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks/Action_menu/Coding">code and style as for action menus</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Interaction">Interaction</h2>

<p>Here you see a user press-and-old on an email message. As a result, an object menu appears prompting the user with various tasks they can perform on that message.</p>
