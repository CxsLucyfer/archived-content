<div class="note">
 <p>Note: If you view this app on the Firefox Marketplace, you may be told that you can't view it because this app is not available for your region. This is due to the in-app payments, and the fact that payments are not enabled in many countries yet. If you set your region to Spain, for example, you will see the app. The in-app payments only work on Firefox OS, and do NOT actually charge you anything. They are just examples, to show how to implement in-app payments.</p>
