 <p>Note: If you view this app on the Firefox Marketplace, you may be told that you can&apos;t view it because this app is not available for your region. This is due to the in-app payments, and the fact that payments are not enabled in many countries yet. If you set your region to Spain, for example, you will see the app. The in-app payments only work on Firefox OS, and do NOT actually charge you anything. They are just examples, to show how to implement in-app payments.</p>
