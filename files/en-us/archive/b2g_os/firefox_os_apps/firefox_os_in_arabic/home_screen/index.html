<p>Hint text will read right to left and is right-aligned. If cursor is inserted, it will appear at right (D).</p>

<p>Search icon is now left-aligned. App icons grid are right aligned, with any Arabic labels reading right to left (E). This is for the default homescreen display: user homescreen customizations and app grouping and organization should be maintained.</p>

<p>Labels that are English proper nouns (brand names) will remain as is - left to right (LTR) in English (F).</p>
