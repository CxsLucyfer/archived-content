<p><a href="/en-US/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works#External_stylesheet">External stylesheets</a> are often associated with HTML documents using the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" title="The HTML &lt;link> element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. Possible uses for this element include defining a relational framework for navigation. This element is most used to link to style sheets.">&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</a></code> element, but it is important to use the element's <code>title</code> attribute properly.</p>

<p>This is because the <code>title</code> attribute on a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" title="The HTML &lt;link> element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. Possible uses for this element include defining a relational framework for navigation. This element is most used to link to style sheets.">&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</a></code> element makes it either <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets">preferred or an alternative style sheet</a>. This can lead to a stylesheet being ignored, which is typically not what an author intends to do.</p>

<h3 id="Why_Titles_Matter" name="Why_Titles_Matter">Why Titles Matter</h3>

<p>The <code>title</code> attribute affects how your external stylesheet is applied to a document. In fact, the use of the <code>title</code> attribute is so significant that HTML 4.01 categorizes stylesheets according to the presence or absence of a title. By including a <code>title</code> attribute, you can control whether a particular stylesheet always affects a document, or if it is only used under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of stylesheets that are possible: <strong><em>persistent</em></strong>, <strong><em>preferred</em></strong>, and <strong><em>alternate</em></strong> stylesheets.</p>

<p>Authors will be most familiar with <strong>persistent stylesheets</strong>, of which any number may be applied to a document at once. A persistent stylesheet is one which has no <code>title</code> attribute and a value of <code>stylesheet</code> supplied for the <code>rel</code> attribute. A document may refer to one or more persistent stylesheets, all of which are used in the presentation of the document.</p>

<p>A <strong>preferred stylesheet</strong>, on the other hand, is one that has a value of <code>stylesheet</code> supplied for the <code>rel</code> attribute, and any value at all for the <code>title</code> attribute. Here are two examples:</p>

<pre>&lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" title="Basic styles" href="basic.css" /&gt;
&lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" title="Fish and boats" href="ocean.css" /&gt;</pre>

<p>According to the HTML 4.01 specification, only <strong>one</strong> of the preferred stylesheets can be used at a time. Therefore, given the above example, only one of the two preferred stylesheets will be applied to the document. The specification does not supply a procedure to decide which one should be used, so user agents are free to make whatever choice they like.</p>

<p>Therefore, any <code>link</code> to a stylesheet that includes a <code>title</code> attribute <strong>cannot</strong> be persistent, and is likely to be ignored by the Web browser. Any <code>link</code> element referring to a stylesheet with a <code>title</code> attribute must be either preferred or alternate, depending on the value of the <code>rel</code> attribute.</p>

<p>In a document that refers to alternate stylesheets, the preferred stylesheet will be used so long as none of the alternate stylesheets are selected by the user. Thus, when the document is loaded, the browser will use <strong>all of the persistent</strong> stylesheets and <strong>one preferred</strong> stylesheet (but remember, there should only be one preferred stylesheet). Once the user selects one of the alternate stylesheets, the preferred stylesheet will no longer be used, although the user can always re-select the preferred stylesheet.</p>

<p>The primary use for preferred stylesheets is to designate one stylesheet as preferred for the document display; that is, it is the "default" presentation. If any alternate stylesheet is selected, then the preferred stylesheet is dropped in favor of the user-selected alternate stylesheet. This is different than persistent stylesheets, which are always applied to a document, whether an alternate stylesheet has been selected or not.</p>

<h3 id="Recommendations" name="Recommendations">Recommendations</h3>

<p>Authors should make sure that any stylesheet which should always be applied is persistent instead of preferred. To quote from <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/HTML401/present/styles.html#h-14.3.1">HTML 4.01 Specification, section 14.3.1</a>:</p>

<ul>
 <li>To make a style sheet persistent, set the <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/HTML401/struct/links.html#adef-rel"><code>rel</code></a> attribute to "stylesheet" and don't set the <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/HTML401/struct/global.html#adef-title"><code>title</code></a> attribute.</li>
 <li>To make a style sheet preferred, set the <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/HTML401/struct/links.html#adef-rel"><code>rel</code></a> attribute to "stylesheet" and name the style sheet with the <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/HTML401/struct/global.html#adef-title"><code>title</code></a> attribute.</li>
