<p>In Gecko 1.8 or earlier, any two <code>file:</code> URIs are considered to be same-origin.  In other words, any HTML file on your local disk can read any other file on your local disk.</p>
<p>Starting in Gecko 1.9, files are allowed to read only certain other files.  Specifically, a file can read another file only if the parent directory of the <em>originating file</em> is an ancestor directory of the <em>target file</em>. Directories cannot be loaded this way, however.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a file <code>foo.html</code> which accesses another file <code>bar.html</code> and you have navigated to it from the file <code>index.html</code>, the load will succeed only if <code>bar.html</code> is either in the same directory as <code>index.html</code> or in a directory contained within the same directory as <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>This policy affects anything that does same-origin checks, including <a class="internal" href="/en/DOM/XMLHttpRequest" title="En/XMLHttpRequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a>, XSLT, and XBL.</p>
<p>For cross-window DOM access, each file is treated as a separate origin, with one exception: if a file is loaded from another file that would otherwise be able to load it following this same-origin policy, they are considered to have the same origin.  This load can occur through a subframe, link, location set, call to <a class="internal" href="/en/DOM/window.open" title="En/DOM/Window.open"><code>window.open()</code></a>, or the like.</p>
<p>For example, if the file <code>/home/user/foo.html</code> is a frameset and one of the frames is <code>/home/user/subdir/bar.html</code>, the frame and frameset are considered to share the same origin.  On the other hand, if the file <code>/home/user/subdir/foo.html</code> is a frameset and the frame is <code>/home/user/bar.html</code>, the frame and frameset are considered to have different origins.</p>
<p>The new <code>security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy</code> preference, which defaults to <code>true</code>, can be set to <code>false</code> if the user doesn't want to strictly enforce the same origin policy on <code>file:</code> URIs.</p>
