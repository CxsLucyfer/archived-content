<p>Â </p>

<p>This document is a guide for developers to the directory structure of the Mozilla source code tree. It gives a bird's eye view of the source code so a developer can get a good idea what is in Mozilla and where to find things. It is a good document for a new Mozilla developer to start learning about the Mozilla code base.</p>

<p>This document contains material for SeaMonkey, Firefox, and Toolkit.</p>

<p>It is a living document which is (supposed to be) updated monthly according to changes in the Mozilla source tree.</p>

<p>See also similar information in <a href="/en/Mozilla_Source_Code_Directory_Structure" title="en/Mozilla_Source_Code_Directory_Structure">Mozilla Source Code Directory Structure</a>, and also see the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Overview" class="link-https" title="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Overview">more detailed overview of how the parts of Gecko fit together</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Introduction:_Common_Subdirectories" name="Introduction:_Common_Subdirectories">Introduction: Common Subdirectories</h3>

<p>A common naming scheme is used throughout the Mozilla source trees. At the top level is the name of the product (e.g. <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/" class="external">seamonkey</a>). At the second level is the name of the module (e.g. the <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/" class="external">editor</a> directory in seamonkey). The third level is where the common naming scheme usually takes over. Many third level directories contain the <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/base/" class="external">base</a>, the <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/public/" class="external">public</a> and the <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/idl/" class="external">idl</a> directories. Although not required, these common names are typically used for a common purpose. If files can be grouped into submodules, they are usually put in their own third level directory and given a unique name (e.g. <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/txmgr/" class="external">txmgr</a> in the editor directory in seamonkey). Beneath this third level directory, there may be fourth level base, public and idl directories. Thus, the scheme is recursive; it can apply to submodules, sub-submodules and so on.</p>

<ul>
 <li>base contains the basic (core) functionality for the module. Base contains all the source code that cannot be categorized into a submodule.</li>
 <li>build contains any special makefiles for building the particular module.</li>
 <li>doc contains any documentation associated with this module.</li>
 <li>idl contains the XPIDL (Cross Platform Interface Definition Language) interface files. Interfaces are used so functionality can be available to both Javascript scripts and C code with as little effort as possible. XPIDL files have their own mini-language and processing tools.</li>
 <li>public contains source code that will be exported to the dist/include directory. They are not all necessarily public in the general sense; some are only meant for internal use in a certain module. As more code is written with or converted to XPIDL interfaces, the value of the public directory diminishes.</li>
 <li>src contains the bulk of the source code.</li>
 <li>tests contains C harnesses, HTML or XUL that exercise this module.</li>
 <li>tools contains scripts for automatically generating certain source code and other special tools for building this module.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also platform dependent subdirectories which contain source code for specific platforms.</p>

<ul>
 <li>windows contains source code for Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0.</li>
 <li>mac contains source code for MacOS: both the PowerPC and 68000 versions.</li>

 <li>motif contains source code for Motif, a toolkit which runs on X-Windows on Unix.</li>
 <li>os2 contains source code for OS/2 Warp.</li>
 <li>rhapsody contains source code for Mac OS X Server (which is based on NeXTStep which is based on X-Windows on Unix) using Yellow Box (Cocoa).</li>
 <li>beos contains source code for <a href="http://www.be.com/" class="external">BeOS</a>.</li>
 <li>qt contains source code for the <a href="http://www.troll.no/products/qt.html" class="external">QT toolkit</a>, a C class library which runs on X-Windows on Unix, Windows 95, Windows 98 and Window NT 4.0.</li>
 <li>photon contains source code for <a href="http://www.qnx.com/products/photon/index.html" class="external">Photon</a>, a microkernel windowing system used in several real-time operating systems from QNX Software Systems Ltd.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="SeaMonkey" name="SeaMonkey"><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/" class="external">SeaMonkey</a></h3>

<p>SeaMonkey is the development name for the Mozilla browser suite.</p>

 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/dom/" class="external">dom</a> contains C interfaces and code for implementing and tracking DOM (Document Object Model) objects in Javascript. It forms the C substructure which creates, destroys and manipulates built-in and user-defined objects according to the Javascript script. For example, if the Javascript script adds a user-defined attribute to the document (e.g. document.goofy = 1), this code will create the "goofy" node, put it on the "document" node and manipulate it according to any later Javascript commands.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/" class="external">editor</a> contains C interfaces, C code and XUL for the embeddable editor component which can edit both plain text and HTML.

 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/gfx/" class="external">gfx</a> contains C interfaces and code for platform independent drawing and imaging. It can be used to draw rectangles, lines, images, etc. Essentially, it is a a set of interfaces for a platform-independent device (drawing) context. It does not handle widgets or specific drawing routines; it just provides the primitive operations for drawing.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/intl/" class="external">intl</a> contains C interfaces and code for supporting localization. It contains code for various character sets, locale formats (e.g. the format of the date and time for different cultures) and other localization facilities.</li>

 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/layout/" class="external">layout</a> contains the C interfaces and code for the layout engine. The layout engine decides how to divide up the "window real estate" among all the pieces of content. It resizes and aligns pieces of content according to the CSS1 and CSS2 (cascading style sheets), alignment styles and the content itself. It does not actually render the content; it just assigns different pieces of the window to various content items. This is known as "reflowing" the content. This code is also known by the names, "NGLayout" and "Gecko."</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/lib/" class="external">lib</a> contains C code used for reference by developers in programming the Mac. It is not used. It shows how to embed the Mozilla browser in a Mac application as well as some sample file-handling code from Apple.</li>

 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/netwerk/" class="external">netwerk</a> contains C interfaces and code for low-level access to the network (using sockets and file and memory caches) as well as higher-level access (using various protocols such as http, ftp, gopher, castanet). This code is also known by the names, "netlib" and "Necko."</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/nsprpub/" class="external">nsprpub</a> contains C code for the cross platform "C" Runtime Library. The "C" Runtime Library contains basic non-visual C functions to allocate and deallocate memory, get the time and date, read and write files, handle threads and handling and compare strings across all platforms. This code is also known by the name, "nspr" and "Netscape Portable Runtime". This code originated in Mozilla Classic.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/other-licenses/" class="external">other-licenses</a> contains code that does not fall under the MPL, including branding, libical and stubs for 7zip.</li>

 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/rdf/" class="external">rdf</a> contains C interfaces and code for accessing various data and organizing their relationships according to RDF. RDF stands for "Resource Description Framework" which is an open standard. This code reads and writes data from and to the local file system, databases, the Internet or any other source using a URL-like syntax.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/security/" class="external">security</a> contains the security modules including NSS and PSM.</li>

 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/sun-java/" class="external">sun-java</a> contains C code so Mozilla can communicate with the Sun JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It does not include the code for the virtual machine itself, though.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/themes/" class="external">themes</a> contains the default themes for Mozilla, modern and classic.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/" class="external">toolkit</a> contains the code for the toolkit used for Firefox, Thunderbird and other standalone applications. This will be covered below.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/tools/" class="external">tools</a> contains C code for the Linux-only Leaky tool. Leaky can help detect memory leaks and XPCOM reference counting problems.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/uriloader/" class="external">uriloader</a> contains C interfaces and code for invoking the correct viewer for the content contained at a certain URL. For example, if this code determines that the content is a mail message, it looks up the appropriate listener (probably Netscape Messenger) and passes the mail message to it for display. It is generic and can hand the content off to internal components (like Messenger), to plug-ins or helper apps.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/view/" class="external">view</a> contains C interfaces and code for different types of views (e.g. scrolling view). A view contains content but does not contain the title bar, borders or other decorations (which are contained by frames). This code serves to manipulate the individual content that it contains. For example, a scrolling view will find out the scroll bar positions and tell its content where to draw according the scroll bar thumbs.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/webshell/" class="external">webshell</a> contains C interfaces, C code, Linux shell scripts and other files for embedding Mozilla in other programs on various different platforms in various different ways (e.g. as plug-in, as ActiveX component, as XPCOM classes).</li>

XPCOM is the mechanism that allows Mozilla to export interfaces and have them automatically available to JavaScript scripts, to Microsoft COM and to regular Mozilla C code. Some low-level XPCOM classes and interfaces are also defined here (e.g. the event loop for all platforms). XPCOM is compatible and very similar to Microsoft COM (although XPCOM is cross-platform).</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/" class="external">xpfe</a> contains the C interfaces, C code and XUL for implementing the "Cross Platform Front End." Essentially, this is where the Mozilla program starts and manages other components to accomplish tasks. This code contains very little platform dependent code; it relies on other components to provide platform independent interfaces to platform specific functionality.</li>
 <li><a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpinstall/" class="external">xpinstall</a> contains the C interfaces and code for implementing the SmartUpdate feature from Mozilla Classic. XPInstall provides code for downloading files, uncompressing them and installing them in a platform independent way.</li>
