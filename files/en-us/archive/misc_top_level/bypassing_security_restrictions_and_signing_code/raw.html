<p><strong>Non-standard</strong><br>
 This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.</p>

<div class="blockIndicator deprecated">
<p><strong>Deprecated</strong><br>
 This feature has been removed from the Web standards. Though some browsers may still support it, it is in the process of being dropped. Avoid using it and update existing code if possible; see the <a href="#Browser_compatibility">compatibility table</a> at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.</p>

<p>Early versions of Firefox allowed web sites to segregate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security_check_basics">principals</a> using signed scripts, and request extra permissions for scopes within signed scripts using a function called <code>enablePrivelege</code>. These <strong>Privilege Manager</strong> feature was not used much (aside from abuse), and its complexity made performance improvements difficult. Signed script segregation was removed in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726125" title="FIXED: Certificate of a signed extension is validated on each startup">bug 726125</a>, the <code>enablePrivilege</code> prompt was removed in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=750859" title="FIXED: Gut unused CAPS code">bug 750859</a>, and <code>enablePrivilege</code> itself was nerfed in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=757046" title="FIXED: Investigate interim solutions for enablePrivilege">bug 757046</a>.</p>

<p>The Privilege Manager has been deprecated in Firefox 12 and disabled in <a href="/en-US/docs/Site_Compatibility_for_Firefox_17">Firefox 17</a>.</p>

<p>Sites that require additional permissions should now ask Firefox users to install an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions">extension</a>, which can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Code_snippets/Interaction_between_privileged_and_non-privileged_pages">interact with non-privileged pages</a> if needed.</p>
