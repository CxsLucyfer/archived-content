<p>Download the latest version of Firefox and install it. Be sure to install the DOM Inspector extension as well.</p>

<h4 id="Extract_Theme" name="Extract_Theme">Extract Theme</h4>

<p>While you can hypothetically begin with any theme already designed for Firefox, for the sake of consistency we'll speak as though everyone is editing the default Firefox theme. This is located in the file <code>classic.jar</code> found in the Firefox installation directory. A .jar file is in reality a renamed zip archive. Opening the .jar files in your archive manager of choice should result in the file being automatically detected as being a zip archive. However, if your application doesn't detect <code>classic.jar</code> as a standard zip archive, rename the file <code>classic.zip</code> and continue extraction.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in <span title="(Firefox 4 / Thunderbird 3.3 / SeaMonkey 2.1)">GeckoÂ 2.0</span>, the new <code>omni.jar</code> file contains the skin, among other resources. See <a href="/en/Theme_changes_in_Firefox_4" title="en/Theme changes in Firefox 4">Theme changes in Firefox 4</a> for details on how to extract skin files from Firefox 4 or later.</p>

<h4 id="Install_Your_New_Theme" name="Install_Your_New_Theme">Install Your New Theme</h4>

<p>Before you can see the changes you make to a Firefox theme (since live edits are restrictively difficult to set up) you must first learn how to repackage the classic theme to make it installable. For the sake of this discussion we will call your theme "My_Theme", though you can replace that with any name.</p>

<h5 id="Copying_The_Necessary_Files" name="Copying_The_Necessary_Files">Copying The Necessary Files</h5>

<p>The first step is to move all the files into the right directory structure. So create a new directory called <code>My_Theme</code>. Into this directory put the <code>browser</code>, <code>global</code>, <code>communicator</code>, <code>help</code>, and <code>mozapps</code> directories from above, as well as the <code>icon.png</code> and <code>preview.png</code> files. (Yes, this means that the structure of your new directory and <code>classic.jar</code> will be slightly different.)</p>

<h5 id="Creating_the_Install_Files" name="Creating_the_Install_Files">Creating the Install Files</h5>

<h6 id="Contents.rdf" name="Contents.rdf">Contents.rdf</h6>

<p>Make a copy of <a href="/en/Creating_a_Skin_for_Firefox/contents.rdf" title="en/Creating_a_Skin_for_Firefox/contents.rdf">contents.rdf</a>, place it in <code>\My_Theme</code> and open it up in your text editor. This file is a small XML Database which is used to describe the skin.</p>

<p>In the code, search for all instances of "My_Theme" and replace them with the name of your theme.</p>

<p>The packages section lists which components of the browser you're modifying. If we also had skins for Chatzilla, we would need to add another line resembling the other ones and change it to point to Chatzilla. But this list includes everything that we changed, so just modify the blue text to point to match the name/version that you used in the sections before this.</p>

<pre class="eval">&lt;RDF:li resource="urn:mozilla:skin:<strong style="color: #0000dd; font-weight: bold;">My_Theme</strong>:communicator"/&gt;
&lt;RDF:li resource="urn:mozilla:skin:<strong style="color: #0000dd; font-weight: bold;">My_Theme</strong>:editor"/&gt;
&lt;RDF:li resource="urn:mozilla:skin:<strong style="color: #0000dd; font-weight: bold;">My_Theme</strong>:global"/&gt;
&lt;RDF:li resource="urn:mozilla:skin:<strong style="color: #0000dd; font-weight: bold;">My_Theme</strong>:messenger"/&gt;
&lt;RDF:li resource="urn:mozilla:skin:<strong style="color: #0000dd; font-weight: bold;">My_Theme</strong>:navigator"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>Save the file and exit the text editor.</p>

<h6 id="install.rdf" name="install.rdf">install.rdf</h6>

<p>Make a copy of <a href="/en/Creating_a_Skin_for_Firefox/install.rdf" title="en/Creating_a_Skin_for_Firefox/install.rdf">install.rdf</a> and place it in the <code>My_Theme</code> directory, then open it up in your text editor. This file is a small XML database that describes the skin.</p>

<pre>  &lt;Description about="urn:mozilla:install-manifest"&gt;
  &lt;em:id&gt;{Themes_UUID}&lt;/em:id&gt;
  &lt;em:version&gt;Themes_Version&lt;/em:version&gt;
</pre>

<p>The first section requires that you establish a <a href="/en/Creating_a_Skin_for_Firefox/UUID" title="en/Creating_a_Skin_for_Firefox/UUID">UUID</a> for your theme and that you give your theme a version number. Once you've done this, insert the information as above, and scroll down.</p>

<p>You will also have to update the minimum and maximum compatible versions for the target application (Firefox) in the following section:</p>

<pre>  &lt;em:targetApplication&gt;
    &lt;Description&gt;
      &lt;!-- Firefox's UUID --&gt;
      &lt;em:id&gt;{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}&lt;/em:id&gt;
      &lt;em:minVersion&gt;Min_FF_Version&lt;/em:minVersion&gt;
      &lt;em:maxVersion&gt;Max_FF_Version&lt;/em:maxVersion&gt;
    &lt;/Description&gt;
  &lt;/em:targetApplication&gt;
</pre>

<p>Establishing both minimum and maximum compatible versions lets you avoid conflicts with versions of Firefox your theme wasn't designed for -- or wasn't tested on.</p>

<p>See <a href="/en/Install_Manifests" title="en/Install_Manifests">Install Manifests</a> for the reference information about the <code>install.rdf</code> file.</p>

<h4 id="CSS_Files" name="CSS_Files">CSS Files</h4>

<p>The CSS files in these directories tell the browser how to display the buttons and other controls, where to put the images, what border and padding it should put around them, and so on.</p>

<p>As an example, let's change the standard button.</p>

<p>Go into the global <code>global</code> directory and open <code>button.css</code> in your favorite text editor. Scroll down to "<code>button {"</code>. This section defines the normal button in its basic state (There is no mouse over it, it's not disabled, and it's not selected).</p>

<p>Change the <code>background-color:</code> to <code>DarkBlue</code> and the <code>color:</code> to <code>White</code>, and save the file.</p>

<h4 id="Repackaging_JAR" name="Repackaging_JAR">Repackaging JAR</h4>

<p>Now all you need to do is repackage a JAR file with the following directory structure, using your favorite archive manager to create a zip archive:</p>

<pre>/browser/*
/communicator/*
/global/*
/help/*
/mozapps/*
/contents.rdf
/install.rdf
/icon.png
/preview.png
  </pre>

<p>Make sure not to just zip up the <code>My_Theme</code> parent directory since that will cause the drag and drop install in the next section to fail without error messages. Once you have put the files in the zip folder, rename it to My_Theme.jar</p>

<h4 id="Triggering_the_install_from_the_web" name="Triggering_the_install_from_the_web">Triggering the install from the web</h4>

<p>To install the theme's JAR file directly from the web, you need to run some JavaScript.</p>

<pre class="eval">&lt;a href='javascript:InstallTrigger.installChrome(InstallTrigger.SKIN,
 "<strong style="color: #0000dd; font-weight: bold;">myskin.jar</strong>", "<strong style="color: #0000dd; font-weight: bold;">My Skin Theme</strong>")'&gt;install My Skin&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you have JAR files on your hard drive and would like to install them, then download/use <a class="external" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/samples/installjar.html">this form</a>.</p>

<p>You can also just open the themes window in Mozilla and drag and drop your .jar file onto it.</p>

<p>Now to change your folder(s) back into a .jar Well it's easy! What you do is put your folder(s) into a .zip file and then when it's compressed make the .zip into a .jar</p>
