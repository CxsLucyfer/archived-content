<p>When preferences sync is enabled, Firefox Sync will synchronize preferences between the same application based on a whitelist. That means preferences between Firefox and Fennec, for instance, are <em>never</em> synced. To sync preferences between Firefoxes, Fennecs, Thunderbirds, etc., ensure the prefs are whitelisted.</p>
<p>The whitelist is determined as follows: for each <code>services.sync.prefs.sync.&lt;pref&gt;</code> preference that is set to <code>true</code>, Firefox Sync will sync the &lt;pref&gt; preference. For example, if your add-on had a pref called <code>extension.frobnaz.foobar</code>, to have it synced, create a bool preference called <code>services.sync.prefs.sync.extension.frobnaz.foobar</code> and set it to <code>true</code>. The most convenient place for this would be your add-on's default preferences, though if you want to give the user a choice to opt-in, you can also do it programmatically.
