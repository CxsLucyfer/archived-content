<p><code>cross-commit</code> is a script that allows a single patch to be easily checked in on multiple branches.</p>

<h3 id="Getting_the_script" name="Getting_the_script">Getting the script</h3>

<p>"make -f client.mk pull_all" from a working copy of the trunk now pulls cross-commit, and that'll work on the 1.8 branch soon, too, so you might already have the script. If you don't, however, then from the parent directory of your source dir, do:</p>

<pre class="eval"> cvs co mozilla/tools/cross-commit
</pre>

<p>Note that you will need to have $CVSROOT and such set up correctly for this to work.</p>

<p>There are a couple of common ways to use <code>cross-commit</code>:</p>

<h5 id="Land_something_simultaneously_on_the_trunk_and_MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH" name="Land_something_simultaneously_on_the_trunk_and_MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH">Land something simultaneously on the trunk and MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH</h5>

<pre class="eval"> # Modify the files (probably by applying the patch)
 patch -p0 &lt; ~/caret.patch

 # Commit on trunk and branch at once
 # Make sure to use -m "Commit message" when doing so
 tools/cross-commit -m "Fix some sort of security bug" layout/base/nsCaret.h
</pre>

<h5 id="Land_something_on_two_other_branches_that_has_already_landed_on_the_trunk" name="Land_something_on_two_other_branches_that_has_already_landed_on_the_trunk">Land something on two other branches that has already landed on the trunk</h5>

<pre class="eval"> # update to the first branch you want to land on
 cvs update -rMOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH layout/base/nsCaret.h

 # Modify the files (probably by applying the patch)
 patch -p0 &lt; ~/caret.patch

 # Commit on all the branches at once
 # Make sure to use -m "Commit message" when doing so
 tools/cross-commit --moz18 --branch MOZILLA_1_8_0_BRANCH -m "Fix some sort of security bug" layout/base/nsCaret.h
</pre>

<h4 id="Notes" name="Notes">Notes</h4>

<p><strong>Note that you MUST use a -m option with a CVS checkin message. Otherwise <code>cross-commit</code> will end up waiting forever for you to type a CVS checkin message in an editor that it never shows you!</strong> (Although it works without specifying -m on the command line if you are using X-enabled emacs on Linux.)</p>

<p><strong>Also note that if you don't specify any branches to commit on, cross-commit will commit to the trunk and the MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH by default.</strong></p>

<h4 id="Details" name="Details">Details</h4>

<p><code>cross-commit</code> accepts the following options:</p>

<ul>
 <li>all CVS options (those to the left of the specific CVS command) and CVS commit options (those to the right of a commit command), although the <code>-r</code> and <code>-f</code> CVS options need to be specified as <code>--cvs-r</code> and <code>--cvs-f</code> to avoid conflict with the similarly named (but different in meaning) CVS commit options. You can list the files/directories you want it to commit on the command line or leave them out and let it recursively troll the current directory.</li>
 <li><code>--verbose=[0|1]</code> makes the script output more text as it runs. This defaults to 1.</li>
 <li><code>--trunk</code> makes <code>cross-commit</code> land the patch on <code>HEAD</code> in addition to any other branches specified. This is equivalent to <code>--branch HEAD</code>.</li>
 <li><code>--moz18</code> makes <code>cross-commit</code> land the patch on <code>MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH</code> in addition to any other branches specified. This is equivalent to <code>--branch MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH</code>.</li>
 <li><code>--branch=branch-tag</code> adds a branch to the list of branches to land the patch on. This may be specified multiple times, each time with a different branch name. This may also be used in combination with <code>--trunk</code> and <code>--moz18</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If no branches are specified, <code>cross-commit</code> will default to landing on <code>HEAD</code> and <code>MOZILLA_1_8_BRANCH</code>.</p>
