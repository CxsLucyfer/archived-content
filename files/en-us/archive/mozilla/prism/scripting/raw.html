<p>Prism allows for some client-side web application customization. The web application <a href="/en/Prism/Bundles" title="en/Prism/Bundles"> bundle</a> is allowed to hold a JavaScript file named <strong>webapp.js</strong> (called the webapp script). This file will be loaded into the Prism chrome window very much like a Firefox extension is loaded into the browser chrome window. It can contain the following functions:</p>
<dl> <dt>startup</dt> <dd>When the app starts, before the user interface is displayed. Since the web application has not yet loaded, the <strong>window</strong> object is still undefined.</dd> <dt>preload</dt> <dd>Just before the user interface is displayed. Returning false causes the application to terminate.</dd> <dt>load</dt> <dd>After the main application windows has finished loading. The <strong>window</strong> object has been initialized and can be used.</dd> <dt>error</dt> <dd>If there is an error loading the main app page (e.g. the server is not accessible).</dd> <dt>shutdown</dt> <dd>Just before the application terminates.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Prism exposes desktop integration features through an property of the <strong>window</strong> object called <strong>platform</strong>. The platform property implements the <a class="external" href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozillasvn/source/projects/webrunner/components/public/nsIPlatformGlue.idl" title="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozillasvn/source/projects/webrunner/components/public/nsIPlatformGlue.idl">nsIPlatformGlue</a> interface, whose methods are described in the following section. Methods of the <strong>window.platform</strong> object can be called from <strong>webapp.js</strong> or from web content. The following code can be used by web content to determine whether it is running in Prism:</p>
<p><code>if ("platform" in window) {<br>
  // Prism-specific code goes here<br>
}</code></p>
<p>See the <a class="external" href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozillasvn/source/projects/webrunner/components/public/nsIPlatformGlue.idl" title="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozillasvn/source/projects/webrunner/components/public/nsIPlatformGlue.idl">nsIPlatformGlue IDL definition file</a> for details of the methods available to Prism apps.</p>
<p>Currently, the webapp script also has access to full XPCOM functionality, just like a Firefox extension. This level of functionality is commonly called chrome-level privileges. It means that the script has a higher level of privilege than scripts in the web content and has access to the file system, clipboard and other parts of the native OS.</p>
<p></p><div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In the future, the webapp script may have lower privileges. We are looking into the security aspects of the higher privilege level.</div><p></p>
