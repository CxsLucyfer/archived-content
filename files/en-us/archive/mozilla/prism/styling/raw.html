<p>Prism allows for some client-side web application styling. The web application <a href="en/Prism%2f%2fBundle"> bundle</a> is allowed to hold a CSS file named <b>webapp.css</b> (called the webapp style). This file will be loaded into the web application content stylesheet and can override the web application's native styles.
</p><p>Simply add the <b>webapp.css</b> to the bundle and it will be injected into the web application, regardless of the platform or OS.
</p><p>It is also possible to create platform-specific styles. In this scenario, the CSS file is specific to an OS. This allows Prism webapps to take on an OS-specific look. To use platform-specific styles, create a folder in the bundle archive for each supported OS and place a <b>webapp.css</b> file in the folder. The folder names MUST match the following:
</p>
<ul><li> Windows - winnt
</li><li> Mac OS X - darwin
</li><li> Linux - linux
</li></ul>
<p>The folder names are pulled from Mozilla and are the same as those used in other Mozilla projects, such as extension and XUL applications.
</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> you can also include a root level <b>webapp.css</b> which will be used if a platform-specific version is not found.
