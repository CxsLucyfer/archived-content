<p>The Space Manager and related classes and structures are an important of the Gecko Layout system, specifically Block Layout. See the High Level Design document for an overview of the Space Manager, and as an introduction to the classes, structures and algorithms container in this, the Detailed Design Document.

<h3 id="nsSpaceManager" name="nsSpaceManager"> nsSpaceManager </h3>
<p>The Space Manager is the central class is a group of classes that manage the occupied and available space that exists in horizontal bands across a canvas. The primary goal of the Space Manager is to provide information about those bands of space to support the CSS notion of floated elements.
</p><p>There are three important parts to the Space Manager API: the parts that deal with the coordinate space of the Space Manager, the parts that deal with the regions managed by the Space Manager, and the parts that manage float impact intervals.
</p><p>The class nsSpaceManager is declared in the file <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/base/src/nsSpaceManager.h" rel="custom">nsSpaceManger.h</a>. The class is only used in the layout module and cannot be exported outside of that module (nor does it need to be). It is not a general purpose class, and is not intended to be subclasses .
</p><p>Here is the class declaration, taken from the source file as of 01.08.02

<h5 id="Algorithm_1:_GetBandData" name="Algorithm_1:_GetBandData"> Algorithm 1: GetBandData </h5>
<p>GetBandData is used to provide information to clients about what space if available and unavailable in a band of space. The client provides a vertical offset, the yOffset, that corresponds to the band that is of interest. This will be the y offset of the frame that is being reflowed. The caller also provides a collection of BandData objects (an array) and the number of items that the collection can handle. If the collection is too small, then an error is returned and the count is updated to indicate the size required.
</p><p>The algorithm to provide the band data is as follows:
</p>
<ul><li> Get a vertical offset in world coordinates (instead of frame-relative coordinates) by adding the y-origin of the SpaceManager to the y offset passed in
</li><li> If the (adjusted) y value passed in is greater than the greatest band being managed, then all space is available so a single trapezoid is returned,marked as available and sized to the maximum size value (passed in).
</li><li> If the (adjusted) y offset intersects a band, then gather the banddata:
<ul><li> walk the internal bandData list from head to tail
</li><li> for each band data entry, see if the top of the band is greater than the (adjusted) y offset requested
</li><li> if it is, then band is below the offset requested, so the area between the band and the y offset is available - create a trapezoid with that region and return it.
</li><li> if the (adjusted) y offset is between the band top and bottom, then get the available space for the band by calling GetBandAvailableSpace
</li><li> otherwise, move to the next band
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h6 id="GetBandAvailableSpace:" name="GetBandAvailableSpace:"> GetBandAvailableSpace: </h6>
<p>This method is called from GetBandData only. It walks all of the bands in the space manager and determines which bands intersect with the band passed in, and if within those bands there are regions that are available or occupied.
</p>
<ul><li> First, walk all of the bands until a band that is to the right of the desired offset is located
</li><li> Starting at that band, walk the remaining bands:
<ul><li> if the current band is to the right of the requested band, then there is available space. <ul><li> if there is more room in the bandData collection, then add a trapezoid to the bandData collection such that it is marked as available and has arect that represents the space between the reference band tna dht band being examined
</li><li> if there is no more room in the BandData collection, estimate the number of entries requires as the current count + twice the number of bands below the reference band, plus two. Return an error code so the caller can reallocate the collection and try again.
</li></ul>
</li><li> check the size of the collection again, if there is no room left then estimate the number of items requires as the current count + twice the number of bands below the band in question plus one. </li><li> create a new trapezoid in the band collection that has a region corresponding to the reference band rect, marked as occupied by either a single or multiple frames.
</li><li> move to the next band
</li></ul>
</li><li> after walking all of the band data, se if we have reached the rightedge of the band. <ul><li> If not, then check for space in the band collection
<ul><li> if there is no room left, then set the count to the current count plus 1 and return an error.
</li><li> otherwise, create another entry in the band collection, marked as available, and with a rect corresponding to the area remain in in the band(e.g. from the right edge of the last band rect to the right edge of the band).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h5 id="Algorithm_2:_AddRectRegion" name="Algorithm_2:_AddRectRegion"> Algorithm 2: AddRectRegion </h5>
<p>Clients call into this method to notify the Space Manager that a new frame is occupying some space.
</p>
<ul><li> First, try to get frame info for the frame. If it is found, return an error since the frame is already associated with a region in the SpaceManager.
</li><li> Next, create a rect from the occupied space passed in by the caller,transforming it first to world-coordinates by adding the Space Manager's offset to the occupied space rect passed in.
</li><li> Create a new Frame Info instance for the frame and rect, returning an error if allocation fails.
</li><li> Check if the occupied space rect (adjusted) is empty, if so, return an error <span class="highlightred">(NOTE: this could be done earlier, or prevented by the caller)</span>

</li><li> cases #2 and #7: the rect is partially above the band rect, so it is divided into two bandRects, one entirely above the band, and one containing the remainder of the rect. Insert the part that is totally above the bandRect before the current bandRect, as in case #1 above, and adjust the other band rect to exclude the part already added.
</li><li> case #5: the rect is totally below the current bandRect, so just skip to the next band
</li><li> case #3 and #4: rect is at least partially intersection with the bandRect, so divide the current band into two parts, where the top part is above the current rect. Move to the new band just created, which is the next band.
</li><li> case #6: the rect shares the bottom and height with the bandRect,so just add the rect to the band.
</li><li> case #4 and #7: create a new rect for the part that overlaps the bandRect, and add it to the current bandRect (similar to case #6) and then move on to the next band, removing that part from the rect passed in. If no more bands, append the rect passed in to the end of the bandRect list.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><i>This algorithm is pretty confusing - basically what needs to happen is that rects and bands need to be divided up so that complicated cases like#2, #4, and #7, are reduced to simpler cases where the rects is totally above,below, or between a band rect. From the current implementation, it might be worth verifying that the final result of the inserts is a correctly ordered list of bandRects (debug mode only).</i>

<h5 id="Algorithm_3:_RemoveRegion" name="Algorithm_3:_RemoveRegion"> Algorithm 3: RemoveRegion </h5>
<p>When a float is removed, the Space Manager is notified by a call to RemoveRegion,passing in the frame that is being removed.
</p>
<ul><li> Get the FrameInfo for the frame passed in. If not found, an error is returned.
</li><li> If the rect for the frame is not empty, then visit each band in the bandList:
<ul><li> for each rect in the band:
<ul><li> if the bandRect is occupied by the frame, either remove the frame from the bandRect (if there are other frames sharing it) and remember that it was shared
</li><li> otherwise simply remove the bandRect (no other frames share it).
</li><li> if the bandRect was shared, then try to coalesce adjacent bandRects
<ul><li> if the previous bandRect is directly next to the current bandRect,and they have the same frame list, then make the current bandRect cover the previous bandRect's full region (adjust the left edge to be that of the previous bandRect) and remove the previous bandRect.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li> if the current band or prior band had a rect occupied by the frame,then try to join the two bands via JoinBands
</li></ul>
</li><li> Finally, destroy the frameInfo for the frame.
</li></ul>
