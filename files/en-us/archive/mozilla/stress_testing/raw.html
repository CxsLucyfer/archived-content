<p>Consume.exe from the <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9d467a69-57ff-4ae7-96ee-b18c4790cffd&amp;displaylang=en">Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools</a> can consume various resources: physical memory, CPU time, page file, disk space and even the kernel pool.
