<p>The <code>application/http-index-format</code> file format is an attempt to provide a generic, extensible file listing format that is principly machine readable. </p>
<h3 id="Syntax" name="Syntax"> Syntax </h3>
<p>Every line in the file must conform to the following generic syntax:
</p>
<pre class="eval">NUMBER: DATA
</pre>
<p>where NUMBER is at least a three digit number (note that more digits are possible in the future) and DATA is separated from NUMBER by a colon and a space. The syntax of DATA is defined by the syntax spec for every NUMBER type. If a NUMBER is encountered that a parser does not understand the parser is required to ignore that line. There is no line length limit. All lines must be terminated by a carriage return followed by a line feed.
</p>
<h4 id="NUMBER_codes" name="NUMBER_codes"> NUMBER codes </h4>
<h5 id="100" name="100"> 100 </h5>
<p>A human readable comment line. Machine parsers should ignore this data. This data is not intended for display to the end user and is only meant as a comment to make the file format clear to a human interpreter.
</p>
<h5 id="101" name="101"> 101 </h5>
<p>Pre formatted human readable information line. This data is intended for the end user of the file format data if there is one. This data should be presented to the user when they are viewing data drawn from the file. </p>
<h5 id="102" name="102"> 102 </h5>
<p>A human readable information line in HTML format. This data is intended for the end user of the file format data if there is one. This data should be presented to the user when they are viewing data drawn from the file. This data should be parsed as HTML.
</p>
<h5 id="200" name="200"> 200 </h5>
<p>Defines the field names for the 201 file index code. A valid 200 line consists of one or more white space separated tokens that describe the name or purpose of the associated column of data. Tokens may not contain spaces. Any illegal characters must be escaped via the URL escaping syntax defined by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">RFC 1738</a>. Note that multiple 200 lines override previous 200 lines.
</p>
<h5 id="201" name="201"> 201 </h5>
<p>Data whose definition stems from a prior 200 line. A valid 201 line consists of one or more white space separated tokens that represent data described by a previous 200 line. Tokens may be quoted or unquoted. Unquoted tokens may not contain white space. Quoted tokens are terminated by the next quote but may not contain carrage returns or new lines. Any illegal characters must be escaped via the URL escaping syntax defined by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">RFC 1738</a>. Note that a 201 line encountered before a 200 line should be ignored.
</p>
<h5 id="300" name="300"> 300 </h5>
<p>A URL pointing to the directory represented by the index if there is one. A valid path token must be URL escaped.
</p>
<h4 id="Valid_200_tokens" name="Valid_200_tokens"> Valid 200 tokens </h4>
<p>Note that all tokens are case insensitive.
</p>
<h5 id="Filename" name="Filename"> Filename </h5>
<p>The name of file that can be used to retrieve the file when combined with the full path provided by the 300 line. White space and 8 bit characters must be URL encoded.
</p>
<h5 id="Content-Length" name="Content-Length"> Content-Length </h5>
<p>Base 10 digits representing the size of the file in bytes. Only digits are legal.
</p>
<h5 id="Last-Modified" name="Last-Modified"> Last-Modified </h5>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123">RFC 1123</a> date format URL encoded.
</p>
<h5 id="Content-type" name="Content-type"> Content-type </h5>
<p>MIME content type. Whitespace and 8-bit characters must be URL-encoded. The MIME-type for a directory can be given as <code>application/http-index-format</code>.
</p>
<h5 id="File-type" name="File-type"> File-type </h5>
<p>One of the following keywords to represent a special status for a file:
</p>
<ul><li> FILE </li><li> DIRECTORY </li><li> SYMBOLIC-LINK
</li><li> SYM-FILE (a symbolic link to a file)
</li><li> SYM-DIRECTORY (a symbolic link to a directory)
</li></ul>
<h5 id="Permissions" name="Permissions"> Permissions </h5>
<p>UNIX type file permission syntax. 3 slots either 'R', 'W', 'X', or '-' representing, in order, Read, Write, or Execute permissions. A '-' indicates that the particular permission is not set. Example "RW-" means read and write permission, but not execute.
