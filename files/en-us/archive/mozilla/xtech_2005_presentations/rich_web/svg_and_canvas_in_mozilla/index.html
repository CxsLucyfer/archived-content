<p>Today's Web browsers offer somewhat limited graphics capabilities to Web developers. Advances in hardware, especially graphics processors, offer the potential for far richer graphics in interactive applications. To realize this potential in Web applications, browsers must expose rich new graphics APIs to Web content. The Mozilla project will meet this challenge with two major new features to be delivered in Firefox 1.5: integrated SVG and a new <code>canvas</code> HTML element. Work is also underway "under the hood" on a new unified graphics architecture that uses 3D graphics processors to accelerate all rendering. This work provides additional benefits to Web developers such as the ability to apply SVG effects to HTML content.
