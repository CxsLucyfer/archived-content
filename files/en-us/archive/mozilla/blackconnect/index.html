</p><p><b>BlackConnect</b> was a <a href="en/Blackwood">Blackwood</a> subproject, trying to build a Java-to-XPCOM bridge to allow interoperability between Java and <a href="en/XPCOM">XPCOM</a> components. The goal was to be able to implement XPCOM components written in Java instead of C++.
</p><p>BlackConnect is now superseeded by <a href="en/JavaXPCOM">JavaXPCOM</a>. For the remainders of the BlackConnect project, see <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/connect/" class="external">here</a>.
