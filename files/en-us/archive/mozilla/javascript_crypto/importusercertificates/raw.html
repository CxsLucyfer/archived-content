   <td><code>
    <i>

   <td>This is the nickname that will be used to describe the certificate in the client's certificate management UI. It should serve to uniquely identify the certificate to the user. For example, "John Smith's VeriSign Class 3 Digital ID" or "John Smith's Ford ID Certificate". However, if this certificate has the same DN as one or more certificates that already exist in the user's certificate store, the nickname associated with the certificate(s) of the same DN in the certificate store is used, and the &lt;tt&gt;"nicknameString"&lt;/tt&gt; parameter is ignored. If the string is null and no certificate with the same DN exists in the user's certificate store, Personal Security Manager uses the following pattern to derive the nickname: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;Common Name&gt;'s &lt;Issuer Name&gt; ID&lt;/tt&gt;.</td>

<p>The <code>importUserCertificates()</code> method is used to import newly issued certificates for the user. The private key for the certificates must already reside in the user's personal private key database.</p>
<p>The request ID in the response being imported must match the request ID in the associated Certification Request or Recovery Request.</p>
<p>If the import operation succeeds, an empty string will be returned. If it fails, one of the following error strings will be returned:</p>
