<p>This method will generate a sequence of CRMF requests that has N requests. One request for each key pair that is generated. The first three parameters will be applied to every request. The "escrowAuthorityCert" parameter will only be used for requests that pertain to a key that is being escrowed. After the "escrowAuthorityCert" parameter, the method takes some JavaScript code that is invoked when the CRMF request is ready. Finally, there are 1 or more sets of key generation arguments. Each key generation will be associated with its own request. All the requests will have the same DN.</p>

<p>The <code>generateCRMFRequest()</code> method will cause the user to be presented with a key generation dialog. The dialog describes the key generation process and gives the user the opportunity to cancel the operation.</p>
