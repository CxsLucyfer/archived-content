<p>The proposed method for accessing Jetpack features that are still in development and may be added in the future is inspired by python's <a class=" external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/__future__.html">future module</a>. In Python, you can call</p>
<p><code>from __future__ import foo</code></p>
<p>which adds the functionality that <code>foo</code> yields to the script. In Jetpack, we propse adding a new function to the base namespace called <code>importFromFuture</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Methods">Methods</h2>
<div class="method"><span class="name">import(<span class="param"><strong class="name">stringMountPath</strong><em> string</em></span>)</span><span class="description">Imports the requested experimental feature into the script.</span>
<div class="params">
<div class="param optional"><span class="name">stringMountPath</span><span class="description">String that enumerates where, starting from the <code>jetpack</code> base, the feature will be mounted. To get a list of mount paths that are available, see the method below.</span><span class="type"> string</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here is an example of how to import a feature (the clipboard) from the future.</p>
<pre class="brush: js"><code class="javascript">jetpack.future.import("clipboard");<br></code></pre>
<p>The goal here is to be able to remove the <code>jetpack.future.import()</code> call when the feature has been formally accepted into the core without additionally changing the script (barring any other changes made during integration).</p>
<div class="method"><span class="name">list()<span class="returns"> array</span></span><span class="description">Returns an array of the set of potential <code>stringMountPath</code> as used in <code>jetpack.future.import()</code>.</span></div>
<p>This is an example of how to get this array. A quick way of displaying the list is to write it to the console.log.</p>
<pre class="brush: js"><code class="javascript">var list = jetpack.future.list();<br>console.log(list);<br></code></pre>
<p>Open the firebug console to view.</p>
