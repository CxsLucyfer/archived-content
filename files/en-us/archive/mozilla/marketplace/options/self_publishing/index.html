<div class="summary">
<p><span class="seoSummary">There may be circumstances where you don&apos;t want to make an app available through Firefox Marketplace. For example, you may want to distribute an app to members of your organization, run a beta test or simply do your own thing. This page explains how to publish apps yourself, outside Firefox Marketplace.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Open Web Apps are installed into Firefox OS, devices running Firefox for Android and desktops running Firefox for Desktop using <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Apps/install"><code>Apps.install</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMApplicationsRegistry/installPackage"><code>Apps.installPackage</code></a>. In both cases, these APIs work by sending the URL of the manifest describing the app to be installed. So the basic requirements for publishing an app yourself are:</p>

<ol>
 <li>a server containing the app&apos;s manifest.</li>
 <li>a server containing the app (for hosted apps) or the app&apos;s packaged ZIP file.</li>
 <li>code on a website to invoke <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Apps/install"><code>Apps.install</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMApplicationsRegistry/installPackage"><code>Apps.installPackage</code></a> as appropriate.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>Before publishing Open Web Apps yourself, you should be aware of the following limitations:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Self-published apps aren&apos;t able to make use of the <a href="/en-US/Apps/Build/App_permissions">privileged APIs</a>. To make use of these APIs your app needs to be a Packaged App and have its ZIP file signed using the Firefox Marketplace submission process.</li>
 <li>Your app cannot make use of Firefox Marketplace in-app purchases.</li>
 <li>You&apos;ll need to implement your own discovery technique, as you won&apos;t have the benefit of a Firefox Marketplace listing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Self-publishing_packaged_apps">Self-publishing packaged apps</h2>

<p>You can self-publish a Packaged App by hosting its ZIP on a server, along with a mini-manifest. The mini-manifest must be in the same directory as the ZIP and is used to identify the app to the install process. You then create a script to invoke <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMApplicationsRegistry/installPackage"><code>Apps.installPackage</code></a> passing it details of the mini-manifest. Let&apos;s look at how to do this in detail:</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  <p>Zip up your app&apos;s contents and give it the name <code>package.zip</code>. This file should contain all the app&apos;s resource files, including the (main) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest" title="Manifest documentation">manifest</a>.</p>

  <div class="warning notecard">
  <p><strong>Caution</strong>: Take care when zipping the content you wish to appear in the Packaged App and don&apos;t include the directory they are contained in. If you zip up the parent directory, the manifest will end up in the wrong place, and the Packaged App will be invalid.</p>
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>Create a file called <code>manifest.webapp</code> and add the content shown below. This file is known as the mini-manifest, because it&apos;s a slightly cut-down version of the manifest file that&apos;s included in your Packaged App&apos;s ZIP file. It&apos;s used by <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMApplicationsRegistry/installPackage"><code>Apps.installPackage</code></a> to undertake the installation of your app. For more detailed information on the content, please see <a href="#Mini-manifest_fields">Mini-manifest fields</a> below.
  <pre class="brush: js notranslate">{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My sample app&quot;,
    &quot;package_path&quot; : &quot;<a class="LinkyMobile-ext" href="http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/my-app.zip" title="Linkification: http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/my-app.zip">http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/package.zip</a>&quot;,
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,
    &quot;developer&quot;: {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A. Developer&quot;,
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;<a class="LinkyMobile-ext" href="http://my-server.com" title="Linkification: http://my-server.com">http://my-server.com</a>&quot;
    }
}</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Create the script that will install your app. Here we&apos;re using a simple HTML file named <code>index.html</code> , but you can add the script to a button or use any appropriate method to invoke it on your website. The JavaScript on this page calls the Packaged App installer API (<a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMApplicationsRegistry/installPackage"><code>Apps.installPackage</code></a>) and includes callbacks that provide notification of whether the installation was successful or failed.
  <pre class="brush: html notranslate">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Packaged app installation page&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      // This URL must be a full url.
      var manifestUrl = &apos;<a class="LinkyMobile-ext" href="http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/package.manifest" title="Linkification: http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/package.manifest">http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/manifest.webapp</a>&apos;;
      var req = navigator.mozApps.installPackage(manifestUrl);
      req.onsuccess = function() {
        alert(this.result.origin);
      };
      req.onerror = function() {
        alert(this.error.name);
      };
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Setup the files on your server or website by copying <code>package.zip</code>, <code>manifest.webapp</code>, and <code>index.html</code> into your chosen directory (<code>my-app-directory</code> in this example).</li>
 <li>Now you can install the app using a compatible device (such as a Firefox OS phone). Simply open the <code>index.html</code> file (in this example its path is <code> <a class="LinkyMobile-ext" href="http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/package.manifest" title="Linkification: http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/package.manifest">http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/index.html</a></code>)  and you&apos;ll get a prompt asking you to confirm that you want to install the app. Proceed with the installation, and once it&apos;s complete your Web page&apos;s script will provide an indication of installation success or failure.</li>
</ol>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can host a Packaged App locally and test it on a device. The Web server and the device must be on the same network, and the server must be able to serve requests from the local network. You just need to include the absolute path in the mini-manifest&apos;s <code>package_path</code>, in the same way as the absolute path is included normally (see below). Remember to include the port information if you are using a non-standard port, for example <code><a class="LinkyMobile-ext" href="http://10.10.12.1:8080/package.zip" title="Linkification: http://10.10.12.1:8080/package.zip">http://10.10.12.1:8080/package.zip</a></code>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Mini-manifest_fields">Mini-manifest fields</h3>

<p>If you publish your apps in Firefox Marketplace you don&apos;t have to worry about creating a mini-manifest, as Firefox Marketplace generates it for you. It does this using the information provided in your app&apos;s manifest, the file you included in the app&apos;s ZIP. You can find details on the content of this &apos;main&apos; manifest in <a href="/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest">App manifest</a>.</p>

<p>For a self-published app you need to create your own mini-manifest. The best way to do this is to make a copy of your &apos;main&apos; manifest and update it as needed. Using a copy will help with the first requirement of a mini-manifest, that <strong>the <code>name</code>, <code>version</code>, <code>developer</code> and <code>locales</code> fields must be the same in both (main and mini) manifests</strong>. You then have some additional content to add, fields that are unique to the mini-manifest: <code>package_path</code>, <code>release_notes</code> and <code>size</code>.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>package_path</code> (required)</dt>
 <dd>The absolute path (full URL, such as  <code> <a class="LinkyMobile-ext" href="http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/package.manifest" title="Linkification: http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/package.manifest">http://my-server.com/my-app-directory/package.zip</a></code>) of the location where the app&apos;s zip file is stored.</dd>
 <dt><code>release_notes</code> (optional)</dt>
 <dd>Information about this release of the app. On Firefox Marketplace this information is provided as part of the submission process.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
 <dt><code>size</code> (optional)</dt>
 <dd>The size of the app&apos;s zip file in bytes. This information is used by <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMApplicationsRegistry/installPackage"><code>Apps.installPackage</code></a> to provide a progress indicator during installation.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre class="brush: js notranslate">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My app&quot;,
  &quot;package_path&quot;: &quot;<a class="LinkyMobile-ext" href="http://thisdomaindoesnotexist.org/myapp.zip" title="Linkification: http://thisdomaindoesnotexist.org/myapp.zip">http://thisdomaindoesnotexist.org/myapp.zip</a>&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;,
  &quot;size&quot;: 172496,
  &quot;release_notes&quot;: &quot;First release&quot;,
  &quot;developer&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Developer Name&quot;,
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;<a class="LinkyMobile-ext" href="http://thisdomaindoesnotexist.org/" title="Linkification: http://thisdomaindoesnotexist.org/">http://thisdomaindoesnotexist.org/</a>&quot;
  },
  &quot;locales&quot;: {
    &quot;fr-FR&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mon application&quot;
    },
    &quot;se-SE&quot;: {
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Min balla app&quot;
    }
  },
  &quot;icons&quot;: {
    &quot;16&quot;: &quot;/icons/16.png&quot;,
    &quot;32&quot;: &quot;/icons/32.png&quot;,
    &quot;256&quot;: &quot;/icons/256.png&quot;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The other fields in this example are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>name</code> (required)</dt>
 <dd>The app&apos;s name. Maximum length is 128 characters.</dd>
 <dt><code>version</code> (optional)</dt>
 <dd>The version of the app.</dd>
 <dt><code>developer</code>  (optional)</dt>
 <dd>Information about the developer, contains the <code>name</code> and <code>url</code> fields. The developer info needs to match between the mini-manifest and the main manifest file in the ZIP.</dd>
 <dt><code>locales</code> (optional)</dt>
 <dd>Localization information. Keys should be in <code>xx-YY</code> format.</dd>
 <dt><code>icons</code> (optional)</dt>
 <dd>Icons for use by the app.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Self-publishing_Hosted_Apps">Self-publishing Hosted Apps</h2>

<p>Compared to Packaged Apps, self-publication of a Hosted App is more straightforward, if you create its content in the same way as you would for Firefox Marketplace publication. This basically means creating the <a href="/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest" title="Manifest documentation">manifest file</a> for your app. You then need to add the code to invoke <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Apps/install"><code>Apps.install</code></a>. This code is essentially the same as that you would use for a Packaged App, shown above, the only difference being that you can make relative reference to the location of the manifest file if you wish.</p>
