<p class="summary">Firefox OS 2.5+ supports add-ons, a feature already familiar to Firefox Desktop users, which allows customization of specific apps or the whole OS — behaviour more to your liking. The Firefox Marketplace acts as a host for add-ons as well as apps; this article provides an overview of how to submit your add-ons for publication.</p>

<h2 id="Submission_step-by-step">Submission step-by-step</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Navigate to <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/content/">Firefox Marketplace Content Tools</a> and log in to the site.</li>
 <li>After you&apos;ve logged in, select the <em>Submit Firefox OS Add-on</em> button to go to the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/content/addon/submit/">Submit a Firefox OS Add-on page</a>; this is where the process starts.</li>
 <li>Click <em>Select a File</em> and select the add-on zip package you want to submit. See the <a href="#Add-on_package_structure">Add-on package structure</a> section below for more details on the required package/manifest format.</li>
 <li>You can optionally add submission notes.  These are only for review purposes and are not publicly available — testing instructions, test login details, etc.</li>
 <li>Click Submit.  Your add-on will now be validated.
  <ol>
   <li>If there are any errors you’ll be sent back to Step 3 to resubmit an updated zip file.</li>
   <li>If not, you will be redirected to your <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/content/addon/dashboard/">dashboard</a>, where all your submissions will be listed.</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>After a reviewer has looked at your add-on, an email will be sent to notify you of the outcome.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Editing_and_updating_your_add-on">Editing and updating your add-on</h2>

<p>After successful submission of your add-on, you can edit/update it by going to your <a href="/en-US/docs/">dashboard</a> and selecting <em>Edit this add-on</em>.</p>

<p>New add-on versions can be added on this page.  Uploading a new version while a previous version is pending review will mark the previous version obsolete and the new version will then be marked pending review instead (a maximum of 1 version can be pending review at one time.)</p>

<p>Once a version is approved then that will be available for installation; it will remain available until a newer version is approved.</p>

<h2 id="Add-on_package_structure">Add-on package structure</h2>

<p>The add-on is submitted as a zip file. This section details what the zip must contain.</p>

<p>The manifest.json (Manifest file) must be in the root of the zip file. Key details are as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>name</code> is required.</li>
 <li><code>version</code> is required.</li>
 <li><code>description</code> is optional but will be used by the Marketplace on the <a href="#Add-on_detail_page">Add-on detail page</a>.</li>
 <li><code>icons</code> is used to find icons to display on the marketplace, and on the device when the add-on is installed.</li>
 <li><code>author</code> isn’t currently used by the Marketplace, but will be shown on the device when the add-on is installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of your add-on will be a typical collection of CSS, JavaScript, icons, etc. Again, this should all be placed in the root of the zip file, not within a subfolder — don’t zip up your project folder; zip up the contents of the project folder.)  For mroe information on developing add-ons, see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Add-ons">Firefox OS add-ons</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Marketplace/Add-ons/Validation">Validation</a> describes the current state of the manifest validator. </p>

<h2 id="Review_Criteria">Review Criteria</h2>

<p>You can review the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Marketplace/Add-on_submission/Review_criteria">Firefox OS add-ons review criteria</a> to make sure your add-on follows it.</p>
