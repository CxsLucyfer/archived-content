<p>For both Hosted Apps and Packaged apps, it's recommended that you have:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Extra screenshots to show the app's main screens. Each submission can have up to 6 screenshots. Ideally you should include a screenshot for each form factor that your app has a distinct layout for, for example:
  <ul>
   <li>Phone: suggested size 320 x 480px, or multiple thereof</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Icons in other sizes, and specified in your app's manifest file, for optimal display in other platforms/contexts :
  <ul>
   <li>A 60 x 60px icon for display on the device.</li>
   <li>32 x 32px, 90 x 90px, 120 x 120px, and 256 x 256px icons for optimal display on various other platforms your app can be installed on, such as Windows 7 and Android.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>The URL of a home page for the app and/or support site for the app. These could be the same thing, or different, depending on your preference (entered into the upload app in <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Submission/Submitting_an_app#Step_3.3A_Details">Step 3</a>).</li>
 <li>Other optional fields in the <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/Manifest">App manifest</a>. While <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/Manifest#name">name</a>, <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/Manifest#description">description</a> and <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/Manifest#icons">icons</a> are the only required fields, there are many other options, for example:
  <ul>
   <li>You will want include information about other <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/Manifest#locales">locales</a> if your app is multi-lingual.</li>
   <li>If you do include locales, then the <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/Manifest#default_locale">default_locale</a> field is required.</li>
   <li>If you want to use specific restricted device APIs or Web Activities in your app, you will need to include the relevant <a href="/en-US/Apps/Developing/App_permissions">App permissions</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Web_Activities">activities</a> in your manifest.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="And_also_...">And also ...</h3>

<p>... you should:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Decide if you want your app to go live on the Marketplace immediately after it is approved. The default is for the app to go live immediately. If you don't want this, uncheck <strong>Publish my app in the Firefox Marketplace as soon as it's reviewed</strong> when you submit your app (selected in the upload app in <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Submission/Submitting_an_app#Step_2.3A_Submit">Step 2</a>).</li>
