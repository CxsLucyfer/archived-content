<div class="summary">
<p>With your app loaded into your Firefox Marketplace submissions, the next step is to update the details that will appear on its Marketplace page.</p>
</div>

<div class="note notecard">
<p>In this step you edit the details (URL, description, etc.) for your app&apos;s default (English) localization. If you have other localizations, or want to modify the details for other country/localization listing, you&apos;ll need to do so using the standard Edit Listing option (see <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Submit/Edit_other_localizations">step 9</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>You&apos;re now on the <strong>Submit an App</strong>, <strong>Edit App Details</strong> page.</p>

<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8245/Page%20header.png" alt="Edit app details page header" style="height: 345px; width: 979px;"></p>

<p>As noted on the page, much of the page&apos;s content is prefilled using the details you&apos;ve provided in your app&apos;s <a href="/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest">manifest</a> file.</p>

<h2 id="App_icon_and_URL">App icon and URL</h2>

<p>Your app&apos;s icon and description, as provided in its manifest file, along with the store listing page URL are displayed in the first section of the page. Marketplace generated the URL automatically from the app name and modified it if necessary to make it unique. From this section you can view the Marketplace listing page, by clicking (1) <strong>Open details</strong> <strong>page</strong>. You can also edit the icon and Marketplace URL, by clicking (2) <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8247/App%20URL%20-%20Display.png" alt="When the page first loads your app name and icon are displayed (based on the manifest content) along with the URL generated by Marketplace" style="height: 136px; width: 978px;"></p>

<p>To change the app&apos;s icon, click (1) the icon. You&apos;ll then be able to browse for a new icon image file on your computer. To change the app&apos;s listing page name, enter a new value in (2) the <strong>App URL</strong> box. Note that if you enter a page name that already exists. you&apos;ll get a warning only when you complete this page&apos;s changes and click <strong>Continue</strong>. You won&apos;t be able to leave this page until the app&apos;s listing page URL is valid.</p>

<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8197/App%20URL%20-%20Edit.png" alt="You can (1) change the app&apos;s icon and (2) enter your own page name for the app" style="height: 130px; width: 978px;"></p>

<h2 id="App_description">App description</h2>

<p>The next section displays the app&apos;s description, also pulled from the app&apos;s manifest file. You may edit the description if you wish in the <strong>Description</strong> box. You can increase the size of the edit box, by dragging the handle in the bottom right of the box. This is a required field.</p>

<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8249/Edit%20description.png" alt="You can create a description over 1024 characters and include some HTML tags to improve formatting. " style="height: 171px; width: 978px;"></p>

<p>Unlike the description included in your app&apos;s manifest, the description you edit here can:</p>

<ul>
 <li>exceed 1024 characters. Remember, however, that a short concise description is preferable, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Prepare/Promoting_your_app#App_listing" rel="internal">App listing</a> in the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Prepare/Promoting_your_app">Promoting your app</a> article for advice on creating an outstanding app description.</li>

   <li>&lt;b&gt;</li>
   <li>&lt;blockquote&gt;</li>
   <li>&lt;code&gt;</li>
   <li>&lt;em&gt;</li>
   <li>&lt;i&gt;</li>
   <li>&lt;strong&gt;</li>
   <li>&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, and &lt;ol&gt;</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="App_categories">App categories</h2>

<p>Marketplace provides users with app lists by category. You must pick at least one category that your app fits into, but can add a second if your app could reasonably fit in a second category as well. For example, if your app provides for capturing, editing and sharing photos you could select both <strong>Photo &amp; Video</strong> and <strong>Social</strong> categories.</p>

<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8251/Categories.png" alt="You must pick one, but can pick 2, categories that match your app&apos;scontent" style="height: 187px; width: 985px;"></p>

You can also increase the size of the edit box, by dragging (1) the handle in the bottom right of the box.</p>
