<p>With your app loaded into your Firefox Marketplace submissions, the next step is to update the details that will appear on its Marketplace page.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
<p>In this step you edit the details (URL, description, etc.) for your app's default (English) localization. If you have other localizations, or want to modify the details for other country/localization listing, you'll need to do so using the standard Edit Listing option (see <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Submit/Edit_other_localizations">step 9</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>You're now on the <strong>Submit an App</strong>, <strong>Edit App Details</strong> page.</p>

<p>As noted on the page, much of the page's content is prefilled using the details you've provided in your app's <a href="/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest">manifest</a> file.</p>

<h2 id="App_icon_and_URL">App icon and URL</h2>

<p>Your app's icon and description, as provided in its manifest file, along with the store listing page URL are displayed in the first section of the page. Marketplace generated the URL automatically from the app name and modified it if necessary to make it unique. From this section you can view the Marketplace listing page, by clicking (1) <strong>Open details</strong> <strong>page</strong>. You can also edit the icon and Marketplace URL, by clicking (2) <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="When the page first loads your app name and icon are displayed (based on the manifest content) along with the URL generated by Marketplace" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8247/App%20URL%20-%20Display.png" style="height: 136px; width: 978px;"></p>

<p>To change the app's icon, click (1) the icon. You'll then be able to browse for a new icon image file on your computer.

Note that if you enter a page name that already exists. you'll get a warning only when you complete this page's changes and click <strong>Continue</strong>. You won't be able to leave this page until the app's listing page URL is valid.</p>

<p><img alt="You can (1) change the app's icon and (2) enter your own page name for the app" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8197/App%20URL%20-%20Edit.png" style="height: 130px; width: 978px;"></p>

<p>Unlike the description included in your app's manifest, the description you edit here can:</p>

<ul>
 <li>exceed 1024 characters.
