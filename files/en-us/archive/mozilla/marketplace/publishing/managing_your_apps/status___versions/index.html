<p>When you submit an app to Marketplace it&apos;s initially excluded from the list of apps shown to users of low-memory devices, such as the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/devices/#intex_cloudfx">Cloud FX</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/devices/#spice_fireonemifx1">Spice Fire One MI FX1</a>. If you believe your app meets the memory requirements for low-memory phones, you can request a review by clicking Request a low-memory review.</p>
