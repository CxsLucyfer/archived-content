 <p>Firefox Marketplace provides you with a variety of statistics about your apps. <span class="seoSummary">This page describes how to access your apps' Firefox Marketplace statistics, the presentation of report data and options to examine specific information within the reports, the available reports, and using exported report data.</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="Accessing_your_app's_stats">Accessing your app's stats</h2>
<p>To access the stats for any of your published apps, in Firefox Marketplace open <strong>Developer Hub</strong> then <strong>My Submissions</strong>. Against each published app you'll find a (1) <strong>Statistics</strong> link.</p>
<p><img alt="In My Submissions, for each published app you will find a link to the app's stats page" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8281/Stats%20link.png" style="width: 990px; height: 210px;"></p>
<h2 id="Introduction_to_reports">Introduction to reports</h2>
<p>When you open the <strong>Statistics</strong> link for your app you'll land on the <strong>Statistics Dashboard</strong> (below), a page that offers a visual summary of the statistics reports available.</p>
<p><img alt="The stats dashboard provides a visual summary of your app's stats and links to the 5 reports" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8285/Stats%20Dashboard.png" style="width: 1041px; height: 723px;"></p>

<h2 id="Using_exported_data">Using exported data</h2>
<p>You may wish to make use of the exported data in a spreadsheet application. None of the main spreadsheet applications (Microsoft Excel, Apple iWorks Numbers, or OpenOffice Calc) provide an import feature for JSON format data. A solution is to convert the JSON export to CSV format, a file format that can be imported into most spreadsheet applications. There are a number of online options for JSON to CSV conversion, these include:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm">Convert JSON to CSV</a> provides for conversion from a file or pasted text with various CSV output options (for example alternative delimiters such as colons and semicolons among others) and text display and CSV file download of the converted data.</li>
 <li><a href="https://json-csv.com/">JSON to CSV - Online converter</a> provides for conversion from a file or pasted text with various CSV output options (comma, tab, or semicolon) and formatted tabular display of converted data and CSV file download. A permalink can be created to the JSON data converted. Free version limited to source files of &lt; 1Mb.</li>
 <li><a href="http://konklone.io/json/">JSON to CSV</a> - provides for JSON data to be pasted to the page and a table of the data displayed. The data can then be downloaded as a CSV file. You can also create a permalink to the JSON/page if you want. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/konklone/json">hosted on GitHub</a> and the author provides some background on the project in this <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/03/11/making-json-as-simple-as-a-spreadsheet/">blog post.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the following resources provide code that you could use to create automated import for various spreadsheet applications:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Excel
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/vba-json/">VBA-JSON</a></li>
