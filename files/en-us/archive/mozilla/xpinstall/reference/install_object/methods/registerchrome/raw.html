<h4 id="Parameters" name="Parameters">Parameters</h4>
<p>The <code>registerChrome</code> method has the following parameters:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    <code>SWITCH</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <code>SWITCH</code> is the chrome switch indicating what type of file is being registered. <code>SKIN</code> is used to register skins, <code>LOCALE</code> is used to register language packs. <code>PACKAGE</code>, a third possibility is the equivalent of <code>SKIN AND/OR LOCALE</code>, and ensures that everything in the XPI is registered. One final option for the switch parameter is <code>DELAYED_CHROME</code>, which registers the switch only after a relaunch of the browser.<br>
    Note that you can combine switches as in the example below.</dd>
  <dt>
    <code>srcDir</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <code>srcDir</code> is a <code>FileSpecObject</code> representing the source destination of the installation. FileSpecObjects like that required by this function are created using the <a href="en/XPInstall_API_Reference/Install_Object/Methods/getFolder"> getFolder</a> method on the Install object.</dd>
  <dt>
    <code>xpiPath</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <code>xpiPath</code> is the path within the XPI in where the contents.rdf file defining the chrome is located. For example, "locale/myLocale/aim," points to the <code>locale/myLocale/aim</code> subdirectory of the same XPI file in which the installation script is located.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="Returns" name="Returns">Returns</h4>
<p>An integer error code. For a list of possible values, see <a href="en/XPInstall_API_Reference/Return_Codes"> Return Codes</a>. In some situations the method may return other errors. In a few cases you may get a registry error.</p>
<h4 id="Description" name="Description">Description</h4>
<p>When the third parameter is omitted (pointing to a specific location within the XPI file), this function is being used in a somewhat deprecated way. In this case, <code>registerChrome</code> is supporting the old format of installation archives, in which the manifest.rdf file was always located at the highest level of the installation archive. In this case, registerChrome does not require a path inside the archive, as it does now in order to locate the more flexible contents.rdf format of installation archives. Note that you can also look in the installed-chrome.txt file in the chrome directory to see how and where the <code>registerChrome</code> function has registered your package with the chrome registry.</p>
<h4 id="Example" name="Example">Example</h4>
<p>Example assumes your XPI file is in Plugins folder and RDF file is in resources subfolder of XPI.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p>You should probably avoid this call (in the case you are copy/pasting from older install scripts) for plugin installation in Firefox 2.x. It is unclear what, if anything, does this "Chrome registration" accomplish.</p>
