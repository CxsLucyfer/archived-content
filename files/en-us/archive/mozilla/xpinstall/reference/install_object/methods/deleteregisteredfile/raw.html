<p>The <code>deleteRegisteredFile</code> method deletes the specified file and removes the file's entry from the Client Version Registry. If the file is currently being used, the name of the file that is to be deleted is saved and Netscape 6 attempts to delete it each time it starts up until the file is successfully deleted. This method is used to delete files that cannot be removed by the <code>uninstall</code> method or to remove files that are no longer necessary or whose names have changed.</p>
