<h2 id="Trigger_Scripts_and_Install_Scripts" name="Trigger_Scripts_and_Install_Scripts">Trigger Scripts and Install Scripts</h2>

<p>Trigger scripts are simple installations that can be initiated from event handlers and other JavaScript code on a web page.</p>

<p>Triggers use the <a href="/en-US/docs/XPInstall_API_Reference/InstallTrigger_Object"> InstallTrigger</a> object methods to compare software versions, install chrome, and perform simple software installations.</p>

<p>Install scripts use the <a href="/en-US/docs/XPInstall_API_Reference/Install_Object"> Install</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/XPInstall_API_Reference/File_Object"> File</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/XPInstall_API_Reference/InstallVersion_Object"> InstallVersion</a> and platform-specific installation object methods to initialize, queue, manage, and perform the installation of one or more software packages.</p>

<p>These install scripts are typically located at the top level of the XPI archives in which the installations are stored. A trigger script may trigger the downloading of a XPI, which in turn will use its own install.js script to manage the complete installation.</p>
