<p>When toolbars are customized, events are sent to their parent window. You can use <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/addEventListener" title="The EventTarget.addEventListener() method registers the specified listener on the EventTarget it's called on. The event target may be an Element in a document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest)."><code>window.addEventListener()</code></a> to listen for these events in order to keep abreast of changes to toolbars.</p>
<p>None of these events contain any data; if you need details, you'll need to look at the toolbar.</p>
<dl>
 <dt>
  <code>beforecustomization</code></dt>
 <dd>
  This event is delivered when the user starts the toolbar customization process; for example, by right-clicking on a toolbar and choosing "Customize".</dd>
 <dt>
  <code>customizationchange</code></dt>
 <dd>
  This event is delivered when the user makes a change to a toolbar while editing the toolbars, either by dragging an item to the toolbar or by dragging an item out of it.</dd>
 <dt>
  <code>aftercustomization</code></dt>
 <dd>
  This event is delivered when the user closes the toolbar customization panel.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In all cases, the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target" title="The target property of the Event interface is a reference to the object that dispatched the event. It is different from Event.currentTarget when the event handler is called during the bubbling or capturing phase of the event."><code>event.target</code></a> is the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/toolbox" title="toolbox">toolbox</a></code> being customized. You can look at the contents of that element and its children to determine what changes were made.</p>

<p>In this example, we watch for toolbar changes.</p>
