<p></p><div class="warning">  <p>On November 30th, 2016, Mozilla shut down the persona.org services. Persona.org and related domains will soon be taken offline.</p>  <p>For more information, see this guide to migrating your site away from Persona:</p>  <p><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_Shutdown_Guidelines_for_Reliers">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_Shutdown_Guidelines_for_Reliers</a></p></div><p></p>

<p>The Persona dialog is currently implemented as a popup window. Modern web browsers typically <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pop-blocker-settings-exceptions-troubleshooting" title="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pop-blocker-settings-exceptions-troubleshooting">block popups</a>, unless they are triggered directly by a mouse click or a key press. This means that your call to <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/id/request" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.id.request()</code></a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/id/get" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.id.get()</code></a> must be made directly from a click or keypress handler. If it's made in response to some other event, the popup won't be shown and the user won't be able to sign in.</p>

<p>For example: suppose your website has deferred sign-in, in which users can browse content, but do not have to sign in until they start editing. If you implement this by calling <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/id/request" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.id.request()</code></a> in response to a focus event on the text field, then the popup will be blocked.</p>

<p>You can still implement sign-in on focus as follows: on the focus event, display a dialog with a "Sign In" button, and have that button call <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/id/request" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>navigator.id.request()</code></a> in its click handler.</p>
