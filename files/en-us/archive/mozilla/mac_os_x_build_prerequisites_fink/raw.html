<p><a class="external" href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a> is a package management system for Mac OS X, alternative to MacPorts. It doesn't seem to be as well maintained (in terms of available packages) as macports, so <b>it is strongly suggested that you <a href="en/Mac_OS_X_Build_Prerequisites#Software_Requirements">use macports</a></b> instead of fink.
</p><p>You may <a class="external" href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">download</a> the most recent version of Fink that is compatible with your operating system release. Fink installs in <code>/sw</code> by default. The installer should configure the Fink environment for you, making it available in any new Terminal window.
</p><p>If you perform a major operating system upgrade on your computer, such as an upgrade from Tiger to Leopard, you should remove the <code>/sw</code> directory and re-install Fink and the packages below.
