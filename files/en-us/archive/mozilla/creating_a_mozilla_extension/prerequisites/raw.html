<ul>
  <li>an installation of Mozilla;</li>
  <li>zip and unzip utilities;</li>
  <li>a text editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also understand tag-based languages like <a href="/en-US/docs/HTML">HTML</a> as well as basic <a href="/en-US/docs/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/CSS">CSS</a>, and the <a href="/en-US/docs/DOM">DOM</a>. You might install Mozilla multiple times in the course of this tutorial, so you will find it handy to keep around a Mozilla installer.</p>
<p>If you currently use Mozilla, you should install a new copy of the software in a different location from the existing installation for the purposes of this demo. This tutorial instructs you to do things that can damage your installation and make it unusable, so don't modify your primary Mozilla installation per the instructions in this tutorial unless you really know what you are doing!</p>
