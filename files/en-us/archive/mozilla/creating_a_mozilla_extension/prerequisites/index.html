<ul>
  <li>an installation of Mozilla;</li>
  <li>zip and unzip utilities;</li>
  <li>a text editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also understand tag-based languages like <a href="/en-US/docs/HTML">HTML</a> as well as basic <a href="/en-US/docs/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/CSS">CSS</a>, and the <a href="/en-US/docs/DOM">DOM</a>. You might install Mozilla multiple times in the course of this tutorial, so you will find it handy to keep around a Mozilla installer.</p>
<p>If you currently use Mozilla, you should install a new copy of the software in a different location from the existing installation for the purposes of this demo. This tutorial instructs you to do things that can damage your installation and make it unusable, so don&apos;t modify your primary Mozilla installation per the instructions in this tutorial unless you really know what you are doing!</p>
