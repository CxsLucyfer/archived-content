<h2 id="UI_in_Mozilla">UI in Mozilla</h2>
<p>Mozilla&apos;s philosophy of using &quot;the right tool for the right job&quot;
is manifested most prominently in the design of the user interface. We provide
an XML-based language called <a href="en/XUL">XUL</a> for defining the user interface of your application. <a href="en/CSS">CSS</a> is used to style these UI&apos;s and DTD&apos;s are used to <a href="en/Localization">localize</a> the textual information
- making your application extremely flexible and able to be utilized across
the globe. <a href="en/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, considered by many to be the best scripting language
ever designed is ideal for specifying the behavior of your Interface widgets.
Where speed is the foremost consideration, we provide C++ libraries with multi-language
interfaces for comprehensive, performant access to networking, filesystem, content,
rendering, and much more.
</p><p>What this means to you as the developer is this: you can take advantage of
skills you already have with <a href="en/XML">XML</a> or web technologies to design and implement
anything from a simple text editor to a comprehensive IDE - complete with all
of the interface widgets that you would find in virtually any major application
framework.
</p><p>Another benefit of this standards-based approach to UI development is that
your application is cross-platform &quot;out of the box&quot;. Imagine not having
to re-write your application 3 times, or not supporting a less popular platform
simply because you do not have the resources for parallel development!

</p><p>Unlike many other application frameworks, you are not limited to the widget
set we provide, nor limited to the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the native OS.
You can create applications using our framework that either have a native look
and feel for each OS, or one which is identical on Macs, PC&apos;s or Unix operating
systems. You may also further enhance the user interface by allowing 3rd parties
to develop <a href="en/Themes">&quot;themes&quot;</a> for your application. Themes are simply collections
of images and CSS which can augment or replace your current UI elements.
</p><p><img alt="Image:mafd_mac.jpg">

<img alt="Image:mafd_macshottoyfactory.jpg">
</p><p>XUL provides an excellent answer for organizations with heterogeneous computing
environments. Customized XUL applications with significant business logic can
be written once, and used on the range of platforms that exist within the organization.
In addition, if the organization maintains sophisticated, interactive websites,
it will already possess a wealth of technical expertise that will be relevant
for creating XUL applications.
</p><p>In addition to the technologies already mentioned, we go even further by allowing
you to even create your own custom interface widgets. Don&apos;t feel limited by
the widgets that the framework already contains! <a href="en/XBL">XBL</a> (eXtensible Binding Language)
allows you to expand your library of interface elements, and even construct
your own XML language for defining your UI. For instance imagine that you wanted
to create a Chess style game. You could easily create XML elements such as &lt;chessboard&gt;
or &lt;chesspiece&gt; and via XBL map these to images and application logic.
This is very powerful since you could make improvements to the underlying application
logic without having to rewrite the higher level code.
</p><p>Our platform also can take advantage of other internet standards such as <a href="en/XSLT">XSLT</a>
and <a href="en/RDF">RDF</a>. RDF, a core element to the framework, allows you to define dynamic
elements in your UI (elements that may change after you have completed the application,
such as a &quot;history&quot; menu item). XSLT could be used to translate information
from <a href="en/XML_Web_Services">Web Services</a>, <a href="en/RSS">RSS</a>, <a href="en/SOAP_in_Gecko-based_Browsers">SOAP</a>, or other XML-based languages and convert them
into a form that you might display in your user interface.

<h2 id="The_Gecko_Rendering_Engine">The Gecko Rendering Engine</h2>
<p><a href="en/Gecko">Gecko</a> is the revolutionary rendering engine that offers advanced features
for Internet browsing anywhere across applications, computing platforms
and devices. This innovation in browser technology offers small size, speed
and industry leading standards support. Gecko is the premier cross-platform,
full-featured, mature and well-tested layout engine available, providing
robust and high quality support for a massive array of standards. Its ability
to render web content correctly is exceptional.
Gecko consists roughly of an <a href="en/HTML">HTML</a> parser and <a href="en/XML">XML</a> parser, a <a href="en/DOM">DOM</a> implementation, a <a href="en/CSS">CSS</a> parser and style system, and the code for CSS-based and HTML-based layout and rendering.
</p><p>As personal connectivity expands from the desktop computer to new web-enabled
products and devices, Gecko is a browser engine that has been designed from
the ground up to power a new generation of desktop browsers and browsing
devices and to accelerate the growth and development of the next-generation
Internet. Small, fast and standards compliant, Gecko is easily <a href="en/Embedding_Mozilla">embeddable</a> across platforms in browsers, desktop applications and browsing devices and delivers full-functionality browsing to them all. Innovative Gecko Technologies it supports make the development of browsers, applications and devices faster and easier than ever before.
</p><p>Gecko is the first browser engine ever to deliver the full <a href="en/Web_Standards">web standards</a> support that developers have been calling for. This robust standards support for the first time makes it possible to implement powerful web applications
with rich user interfaces without using proprietary or platform dependent code. Because Gecko has a cross-platform architecture, is easily embeddable and is open source, it and the rich web applications it supports will be usable on any supported platform or device. This will dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of developing and distributing rich web applications and full-functionality browsing devices that run them. By meeting the needs of developers and companies who are working to provide consumers with new interactive applications, solutions and services, Gecko will become a key catalyst for new growth and innovation and for delivering anytime, anywhere access to millions of new users.
</p><p>As the heart of a browser, the browser engine software component is responsible
for interpreting and rendering the graphics, text and script on the Web.
With Gecko, Mozilla has cleanly separated the browser engine component from
the rest of the client software so it can be embedded and used to interpret,
display and run web content, applications and services on any computing
platform or device.
</p><p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/licensing.html" class="external">Open source</a> and freely available, Gecko is small in size and modular and achieves rendering speed superior to all other browser engines - which makes it perfect for embedding into both desktop applications such as browsers and new devices such as browsing appliances and set top boxes. Supporting Gecko Technologies provide a complete set of resources for efficient development, including full support of web standards, a cross-platform/cross-device user interface language, an extensible architecture and embedding technologies.
</p><p>With its unprecedented power, speed and standards support, the Gecko browser engine represents a major advance for developers. With Gecko, developers seeking a streamlined way to create and distribute web-based services across multiple platforms and devices can write once to W3C standards and their content and web applications will be accessible from across computing platforms and devices.
</p><p>Gecko is based on contributions from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/" class="external">mozilla.org</a>, the organization chartered with managing Netscape&apos;s open source initiative among thousands of Internet developers and participating vendors such as Netscape.
</p><p>The Gecko browser engine offers several key benefits including:
</p>
<ul><li> Size: Gecko has been designed to be lean and modular, bringing full-functionality browsing to a variety of new consumer devices. Because it is small,
</li><li> Gecko can be embedded on devices with limited footprints and it minimizes download size for desktop browsers.
</li><li> Speed: Gecko has been designed for speed and is several times faster than previous versions of Internet browsing software.
</li><li> Standards Support: Gecko is the first browser technology to fully implement the latest W3C standards and enables developers to build rich, dynamic web pages and web-based applications that look and run as intended across a variety of platforms and devices. This saves developers time and money while allowing them to deliver state-of-the-art content and web applications. Gecko features full support for open Internet standards such as CSS1, HTML 4.0, DOM1, RDF, XML and JavaScript.
</li><li> Modular, Embeddable: Gecko&apos;s modular architecture enables developers to add or remove modules with little effort, fitting the software to the available hardware and adjusting functionality to match product requirements. Gecko is implemented as a collection of <a href="en/XPCOM">XPCOM components</a> that can be easily added or removed. Flexible programming interfaces such as the Web Shell API, the Java wrapper API and the Gecko ActiveX Control make Gecko easily embeddable into applications and devices.
</li><li> Full Browser Functionality: Gecko allows any desktop application as well as new devices, products and appliances to be web-enabled, with complete browser functionality. Supported standards and features include Data Transport Protocols, Multilingual Character Data, Image Data, Java and <a href="en/Plugins">Plugins</a>.
</li><li> Open Source: Gecko represents the first software release from Netscape and mozilla.org&apos;s open source initiative. By harnessing the talent of thousands of developers worldwide, mozilla.org has accelerated Internet software development and increased the quality of the final product, delivering unmatched support for web standards. In addition, independent software developers and corporate Information Technology departments now have complete access to the modular source code and freedom to freely license the source, make changes and build customized versions to accommodate their individual needs.
</li><li> Free: Gecko is free of charge. There is no charge for using the Gecko browser engine or Gecko Technologies, including distributing Gecko inside another product. Furthermore, when embedding Gecko, developers are free to choose what modules to include. There is no requirement for distribution of any other software.

<h2 id="The_Necko_Network_Library">The Necko Network Library</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/netlib/necko.html" class="external">Mozilla&apos;s Network library</a> (aka Necko) provides an extensible, platform-independent API
for several layers of networking from transport to presentation layers. Its provides
a generic and extensible framework for fetching URLs with support for common protocols
(http, ftp, file, etc.) and a way to plug in custom protocol handlers. Necko also provides
an abstract &quot;file descriptor&quot; interface for low-level data access.
</p><p>Necko features include support for asynchronous I/O, a generic disk and memory cache service,
asynchronous caching DNS resolution, web proxies, and HTTPS. The following architectural diagram
depicts Necko and its interaction with subsystems:
</p><p><img alt="Image:mafd_subsystems.png">
</p><p>Necko is powerful, stable and robust, with current development focused on performance and standards-compliance.
It has gone through extensive field testing and revision to maximize web site compatibility.
</p>
<h2 id="XPCOM_the_Cross_Platform_Component_Object_Model">XPCOM, the Cross Platform Component Object Model</h2>
<p>The <a href="en/XPCOM">Cross Platform Component Object Model</a> (XPCOM) is one of the
main things that makes the Mozilla application environment an actual
<i>framework</i>. It is a development environment that provides the
following features for the cross-platform software developer:
</p>
<ul><li> component management
</li><li> file abstraction
</li><li> object message passing
</li><li> memory management
</li></ul>
<p>This component object model makes virtually all of the
functionality of Gecko available as a series of components, or
reusable cross-platform libraries, that can be accessed from the
browser or scripted from any Mozilla application.
Applications that want to access the various Mozilla XPCOM
libraries (networking, security, DOM, etc.) use a special layer of
XPCOM called <i><a href="en/XPConnect">XPConnect</a></i>, which reflects the library interfaces
into <a href="en/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (or other languages). XPConnect glues the <a href="#UI_in_Mozilla">front end</a>
to the C++-based components in XPCOM, and it can be extended to
include scripting support for other languages: <a href="en/PyXPCOM">PyXPCOM</a> already offers support
for Python, Java is supported by <a href="en/JavaXPCOM">JavaXPCOM</a>, and there are efforts underway to add <a href="en/PlXPCOM_(external)">Perl</a> and <a href="en/RbXPCOM_(external)">Ruby</a>
language support for XPConnect.
</p><p>On the developer side, XPCOM lets you to write components
in C++, JavaScript, Python, or other languages for which
special bindings have been created, and compile and run those
components on dozens of different platforms, including these
and others where Mozilla itself is supported:
</p>
<ul><li> Microsoft Windows
</li><li> GNU/Linux
</li><li> HP-UX
</li><li> AIX
</li><li> Solaris
</li><li> OpenVMS
</li><li> Mac OS X
</li><li> *BSD
</li></ul>
<p>The flexibility to reuse the XPCOM components from the Gecko
library and develop new components that run on different platforms can
make your application development faster, more productive, and easier
to maintain. The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/netlib/necko.html" class="external">networking library</a>, for
example, is a set of XPCOM components that can be accessed and used by
any Mozilla application. File I/O, security, password management, and
profiles are also separate XPCOM components that you can use in your
own application development.
</p><p>Other Features of XPCOM:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="en/XPIDL">XPIDL</a>, a language for defining interfaces in a language-neutral way and the <a href="en/XPIDL/xpidl">XPIDL compiler</a> can create header files, binary type libraries, documentation, and even generate stub C++ code for your component implementations. Tools including various XPCOM manager interfaces, smart pointers, special string classes, and an extensive collection of macros that make your C++ implementations easy to write and extend.
</li><li> A special base class, &lt;tt&gt;<a href="en/NsISupports">nsISupports</a>&lt;/tt&gt;, that helps manage object lifetime and reference counting.
</li><li> Sample component implementations you can extend and learn from.
</li><li> Documentation.
</li></ul>
<h2 id="Web_Services">Web Services</h2>
<p>Mozilla includes built-in support for popular <a href="en/XML_Web_Services">web services standards</a> <a href="en/XML_Extras">XML-RPC</a>, <a href="en/SOAP_in_Gecko-based_Browsers">SOAP</a>, and <a href="en/Accessing_Web_Services_in_Mozilla_Using_WSDL_Proxying">WSDL</a> as well as
a simple <a href="en/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a> object similar to the one in IE. All services are available from JavaScript code,
which allows even simple XUL+JS applications to take advantage of them.
</p><p>Mozilla&apos;s XML-RPC support includes synchronous and asynchronous requesting and downloading of data
from a server. Its SOAP support is broad and includes.... Mozilla has introductory support for WSDL...
</p><p>Mozilla engineers have written and are in the process of refining a <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=108425&amp;action=view" class="external">new security model for web services</a> that will ease the deployment of applications using web services while maintaining the security of sites inside the user&apos;s firewall.

<h2 id="XPInstall_Mozilla&apos;s_Cross_Platform_Installation_Technology">XPInstall, Mozilla&apos;s Cross Platform Installation Technology</h2>
<p>One of the many things that makes the Mozilla platform easy for
both users and developers is that applications can be installed,
extended, or upgraded with simple web page links. The technology that
makes this possible, <a href="en/XPInstall">XPInstall</a>, allows application developers to write
JavaScript installations that manage special cross-platform
installation archives (called <a href="en/XPI">XPIs</a>, or &quot;zippies&quot;), in which packages
such as new <a href="en/Themes">skins for the browser</a>, patches, <a href="en/Extensions">browser extensions</a>, new
Gecko-based applications, and third party standalone applications are stored.
</p><p>XPInstall makes it easy to write both simple installation scripts
and complex installations that check versions, log installation data
to the local system, execute other installers, and update the
appropriate registry settings. It is often used to install
Mozilla-based applications and browser add-ons, but can just as easily
be used to create installations for third party software that use the
browser as a delivery device on any platform.
</p><p><a href="http://www.mozdev.org/" class="external">MozDev</a> is just one place where this
cross-platform installation technology is used to provide a simple
installation and registration facilities for Mozilla application
developers. The <a href="http://mozblog.mozdev.org" class="external">mozblog</a>
application hosted at mozdev.org, for example, uses XPInstall
to make <a href="http://mozblog.mozdev.org/installation.html" class="external">several different versions</a> available simultaneously as updates are made and
the browser itself advances versions.
</p><p>The XPInstall API makes the following functionality available as
high-level JavaScript objects:
</p>
<ul><li> An install trigger that initiates installations
</li><li> Windows registry access
</li><li> Mozilla registration interfaces for registering new Mozilla software
</li><li> Facilities for detecting and maintaining application versions
</li><li> High-level objects for manipulating local directories and files
</li><li> <a href="en/XPInstall_API_Reference">Complete reference documentation</a>, including useful <a href="en/XPInstall_API_Reference/Examples">example installations</a>
</li></ul>
<p>The following snippet from an XPInstall installation gives
you some idea about how easy it is to write cross-platform
installations that use the Mozilla browser:
</p>
<pre class="eval">// Register chrome
registerChrome(PACKAGE | DELAYED_CHROME, getFolder(&quot;Chrome&quot;,&quot;xmlterm.jar&quot;), &quot;content/xmlterm/&quot;);
registerChrome(SKIN | DELAYED_CHROME, getFolder(&quot;Chrome&quot;,&quot;xmlterm.jar&quot;), &quot;skin/modern/xmlterm/&quot;);
registerChrome(LOCALE | DELAYED_CHROME, getFolder(&quot;Chrome&quot;,&quot;xmlterm.jar&quot;), &quot;locale/en-US/xmlterm/&quot;);

if (getLastError() == SUCCESS)
    performInstall();
else {
   alert(&quot;Error detected: &quot;+getLastError());
   cancelInstall();
}
</pre>
