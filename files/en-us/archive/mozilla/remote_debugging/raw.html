<p>When a bug is reproducible by a community member, but not on a developer's computer, a last-resort strategy is to debug it <em>on</em> the community member's computer. The crash victim should at least know how to run a debugger, if not how to use it, and should have a <a href="/En/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions" title="En/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions">debug build of Firefox</a> handy.</p>
<p>This requires quite a bit of trust, in both directions. The developer trusts that his time is not being wasted: the crash is a real bug in Firefox. (That is, there's a legitimate reason it happens only on some computers, but that reason just hasn't been discovered.) The crash victim, in turn, trusts the developer with full access to his computer.</p>
<p>A good place to start is a detailed stack (in gdb, use <code>bt</code> followed by <code>bt full)</code>.  There give more information about the stack than a Breakpad crash report: not only the names of the functions on the stack, but also the values they were passed.</p>
<h2 id="Core_dump">Core dump</h2>
<p>A <a class=" external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump">core dump</a> includes all of the memory of a crashed program. It allows you to see the crash in a debugger even after the program has long exited.</p>
<p>Transferring a core dump is tricky, because it is large and can contain private information.</p>
<h3 id="Core_dumps_on_Mac_and_Linux">Core dumps on Mac and Linux</h3>
<p>To generate a core dump on Mac, type "ulimit -c unlimited", run Firefox from the command line, and make Firefox crash. When Firefox crashes, a core will be placed in /Cores. You can then load the core file into gdb (gdb firefox-bin corefile), and it will be as if you caught the crash while running Firefox under gdb!</p>
<p>When transferring a Mac or Linux core dump, you'll also have to transfer the Firefox executable (and maybe more).</p>
<h3 id="Core_dumps_on_Windows">Core dumps on Windows</h3>
<p>On Windows you can produce a "minidump". <a href="/en/Capturing_a_minidump" title="en/Capturing a minidump">See here for instructions</a> on how to do so with Microsoft's free debugger, WinDBG.</p>
<h2 id="Debugging_over_Bugzilla">Debugging over Bugzilla</h2>
<p>Explain in the bug that you have a core file or can reproduce the crash as many times as needed. The developer can give you appropriate commands to type into the debugger.</p>
<p>Examples: 367650, 374356, 393325, 418139</p>
<h2 id="Debugging_over_IRC">Debugging over IRC</h2>
<p>Find the developer on IRC and explain that you've caught the bug in a debugger. Since debugging usually requires printing many objects, this is much faster than debugging over Bugzilla.  Use <a class="external" href="http://pastebin.mozilla.org/" title="http://pastebin.mozilla.org/">pastebin.mozilla.org</a> for anything too long to paste into IRC.</p>

<p>Offer to let a developer control your computer using <a class=" external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software">Remote desktop software</a> such as <a class=" external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC">VNC</a> or <a class=" link-https" href="https://www.copilot.com/">Fog Creek Copilot</a>.</p>

<p>If you happen to live in Mountain View, California, you can probably hand your laptop to a Mozilla developer for a bit.</p>
