<p>The next phase of Plug-n-Hack (PnH) is still being planned but is intended to allow browsers to advertise their capabilities to security tools.</p>
<p>This will allow the tools to obtain information directly from the browser, and even use the browser as an extension of the tool.</p>
<p>If you are interested in working on this aspect then please get in touch.</p>
