<p>The metro browser chrome test suite is an automated testing framework designed to allow testing of the immersive version of Firefox for Windows 8 and above using JavaScript. It currently allows you to run JavaScript code in the same scope as the immersive browser and report results using the same functions as the <a href="/en/Mochitest" title="en/Mochitest">Mochitest test framework</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Running_the_browser_chrome_tests" name="Running_the_browser_chrome_tests">Running the metro browser chrome tests</h3>
<p>To run Mochitest, first <a href="/En/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions" title="en/Build_Documentation">build Mozilla</a> with your changes; then run</p>
<pre>./mach mochitest-metro</pre>
<p>This will launch metro browser chrome tests in the default immersive browser. For information on setting your local build as the default, visit the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Windows_8_Integration" title="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Windows_8_Integration">Windows 8 Integration</a> wiki page.</p>
<p>It is possible to run individual tests as well. As with <a class="internal" href="/en/Mochitest" title="En/Mochitest">Mochitest</a>, the path given as an argument is the path to a test file within the Mozilla source tree. If the path points to the root tests directory, then all metro browser chrome tests will be run.</p>
<p>For example, to run a specific test the command would be:</p>
<pre>./mach mochitest-metro browser/metro/base/tests/mochitest/(testfile)
</pre>
<h3 id="Writing_browser_chrome_tests" name="Writing_browser_chrome_tests">Writing browser chrome tests</h3>
<p>Metro browser chrome tests make use of a common framework for defining and running tests. A simple test looks like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">gTests.push({
  desc: "Test loading about:blank",
  setUp: function () { },
  tearDown: function () { },
  run: function () {
    yield addTab("about:blank");
    is(tab.browser.currentURI.spec, "about:blank", "about:blank is loaded");
  }
});

function test() {
  runTests();
}
</pre>
<p><code>gTests</code> contains individual tests that make up the library of tests your test file will contain. Each test can have start up and tear down logic, plus the body of the test contained in <code>run()</code>. The test file can contain other functions which will be ignored unless invoked by <code>test()</code>. <code>gTests</code> make use of Promises and Tasks for managing execution.</p>
<p>Test comparison functions used in metro browser chrome tests are identical to those supported by Mochitests, see <a href="/en/Mochitest#Test_functions" title="en/Mochitest#Test_functions">how the comparison functions work</a> in the Mochitest documentation for more details.</p>
<h4 id="Test_functions" name="Test_functions">Helper functions</h4>
<p>The <a class="external" href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/testing/mochitest/tests/SimpleTest/EventUtils.js" title="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/testing/mochitest/tests/SimpleTest/EventUtils.js">EventUtils helper functions</a> are available on the <code>EventUtils</code> object defined in the global scope. Additional metro specific test helpers can be found in <code>/browser/metro/base/tests/</code><code>mochitest/head.js</code>.</p>
<p>You may add additional common utils and helpers to <code>head.js</code>. Be careful about changing existing helpers as changes may impact tests in other libraries.</p>
<h4 id="Test_functions" name="Test_functions">Static content for tests</h4>
<p>Static content (html files, images, etc.) should be stored in sub directories to avoid polluting the main test directory. Sub directories for larger test suites may also be created.</p>
<h4 id="Test_functions" name="Test_functions">Exceptions in tests</h4>
<p>Any exceptions thrown under <code>test()</code> will be caught and reported as a general failure. <code>setUp()</code>, <code>tearDown()</code>, and <code>run()</code> each have individual exception handlers to prevent one method from interfering with the execution of another. An exception in any of these methods will cause a test failure. Additional built-in framework test checks will run after the completion of each individual test insuring tests clean up properly. For more information on test execution see the main test exectuon loop in <code>head.js</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Adding_a_new_browser_chrome_test_to_the_tree" name="Adding_a_new_browser_chrome_test_to_the_tree">Adding a new browser chrome test to the tree</h3>
<p>To add a new metro browser chrome test add the test file to the <code>BROWSER_TESTS</code> variable in <code>/browser/metro/base/tests/mochitest/Makefile.in</code>. Your test file name must be prefixed with "browser_", and must have a file extension of ".js". Files that don't match this pattern will be ignored by the test harness. Using a descriptive file name is strongly encouraged instead of just using a bug number.</p>
