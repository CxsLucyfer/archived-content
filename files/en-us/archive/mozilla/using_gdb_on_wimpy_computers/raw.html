<p>If your computer has less than 256 MB of memory, your computer will become unhappy as GDB loads Mozilla's shared libraries. The solution to this is to delay loading shared libraries until they are actually needed. However, you need to make sure that the base libraries like libc and pthreads are loaded before you tell GDB to stop loading shared libraries. If you don't allow those libraries to be loaded then GDB will not be able to properly debug threads on Linux. Mozilla uses pthreads for its networking library so you need to be able to work in a threaded environment. The best way to do this is to set a breakpoint in main, let the program run until main and then turn off automatic library loading. From there you can allow the program to continue running. Here's an example:</p>
<pre class="eval">[blizzard@gunhead mozilla]$ cd dist/bin/
[blizzard@gunhead bin]$ ./mozilla -g
.//run-mozilla.sh -g ./mozilla-bin
MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/home/blizzard/src/mozilla/mozilla/dist/bin

       SHLIB_PATH=/home/blizzard/src/mozilla/mozilla/dist/bin
          LIBPATH=/home/blizzard/src/mozilla/mozilla/dist/bin
      MOZ_PROGRAM=./mozilla-bin

        moz_debug=1
     moz_debugger=

<p>It's easy to define a function for gdb to do this for you automatically. You can add this function to the .gdbinit file in your home directory:</p>
<pre class="eval">def prun
        tbreak main
        run
        set auto-solib-add 0
end
</pre>

<p>If you have turned off automatic shared library loading, you will have to load them when you need them. GDB has a command to load libraries while the program is running. This is the <code>sharedlibrary</code> command. It can be shortened to <code>shar</code> when used in GDB. The argument to the command is a regular expression for the libraries to be loaded. Here's what it looks like in the 4.18 version of the debugger:</p>
<pre class="eval">^C

<p>As you see above, it's possible to load more than one library with the same load command in GDB.</p>

<p>Versions of GDB earlier than 5 use a very slow algorithm for walking the list of already loaded symbols as it adds symbols to its symbol table. This has been fixed in version 5 of GDB. There isn't a fix for older versions.</p>
