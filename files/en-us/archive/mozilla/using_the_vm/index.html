<p>The Mozilla build VM is no longer maintained or supported. Thanks to significant improvements in our build environment setup process, it's much simpler and easier to get set up and stay up to date by starting withÂ  <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Simple_Firefox_build">Building Firefox</a> instead.</p>

Generally, there should be enough information in the bug to get started. Whenever you need help, contact the mentor via Matrix, in the bug itself, or by email. When you've completed the bug, they will help you get your code into the tree.</li>

We are in the process of migrating these bugs to mentored bugs, but more recent "good first bugs" may be good starting points if there are no appropriate mentored bugs.</li>
