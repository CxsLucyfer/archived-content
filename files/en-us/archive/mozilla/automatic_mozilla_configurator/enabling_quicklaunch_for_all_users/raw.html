<p>Unlike all other settings, Quicklaunch is stored in the Windows registry. To enable it, just load the following registry script into the user's Windows registry: <a class="external" href="http://alain.knaff.lu/howto/MozillaCustomization/quicklaunch.reg">quicklaunch.reg</a>.
This can be performed automatically by including the following command into the Windows logon script:
</p>
<pre>regedit /s \\server\netlogon\reg\quicklaunch.reg
