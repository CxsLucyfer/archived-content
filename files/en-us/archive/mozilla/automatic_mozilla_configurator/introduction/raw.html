<p>These pages describes how to customize mozilla for multi-user community. In the scenario described described, a bunch of client workstations running Windows access a Linux Samba server, on which the user's home directories are stored (under drive H:). Our goal is to make it possible to automatically generate a Mozilla configuration on the server for each user as soon as he is created. Moreover, we want to lock certain settings, so that users cannot change them.
