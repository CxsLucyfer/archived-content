<p>The easyest way to put into place the registry.dat file for a user would theoretically be to put it into the user's profile directory on the server. However, this issue is problematic, because: </p><p>When the users logs in for the first time, Windows 2000 apparently doesn't load the profile from the server... </p><p>In other Windows versions, Internet Explorer (which is hard to kick off completely) likes to install "Personnalized settings" when the user logs in for the first time, and this seems to have the interesting "side-effect" of wiping any non-microsoft subfolders from <code>%USERPROFILE%\Application Data</code>, including Mozilla's .
</p><p>In order to prevent this, it's preferable to have mozilla's <code>registry.dat</code> file copied over from the server using the logon script. Moreover, it's advisable to "protect" the mozilla registry using <code>attrib +r +s</code> in case the logon script is finished before IE's "Personnalized settings" have completed their dirty deed...
</p><p>In summary, you can use the following series of commands in your logon script (usually stored in <code>/home/samba/netlogon/STARTUP.BAT</code> on the server):
