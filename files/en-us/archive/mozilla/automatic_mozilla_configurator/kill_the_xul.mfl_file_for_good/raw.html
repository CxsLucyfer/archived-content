<p>Mozilla creates in its profile directory a file named <code>XUL.mfl</code>, which contains pre-compiled UI elements. This is meant to speed up the operation of Mozilla, however in a fileserver based environment, this can be problematic:
</p>
<ul><li> At several megabytes a pop, these files will take up a considerable amount of space, because each user has his own... </li><li> Loading these files from the server, and storing them back slows down the network, thus it may actually be faster without than with </li><li> <a class="external" href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22XUL.mfl%22">XUL.mfl occasionnally gets corrupted</a>, needing a manual intervention to wipe it out, before mozilla again works correctly. </li><li> With Quicklauncer (see above), mozilla's speed is actually quite adequate, even without XUL.mfl </li></ul>
<p>For these reasons, it is desirable to disable the <code>XUL.mfl</code> functionality. Unfortunately, there appears to be no "clean" way of doing so (javascript command in <code>prefs.js</code> or registry setting). But creating a subdirectory named <code>XUL.mfl</code> in mozilla's profile directory seems to help (mozilla is not smart enough to remove the directory before creating the file, thus the presence of the directory effectively disables this (mis)feature).
</p><p>N.B. It seems that as of version 1.5, the <code>XUL.mfl</code> file no longer is a problem, so this part may be skipped if you have a recent enough Mozilla version.
