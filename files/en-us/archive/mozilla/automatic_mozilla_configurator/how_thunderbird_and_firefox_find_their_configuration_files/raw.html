<p>Thunderbird looks into the binary <code>%APPDATA%\Thunderbird\profiles.ini</code> file for its "registry", which contains, amongst other information, a pointer to the directory where the profile is stored (usually located in <code>%APPDATA%\Thunderbird\Profiles\profileName</code>).
</p><p>Likewise, Firefox uses a similar file, located in <code>%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\profiles.ini</code>.
</p><p>The value contained in this key is a litteral value, no variables (such as <code>%USERPROFILE%/MozProfile</code>) allowed. We chose to point this to the user's home directory (<code>H:\Thunderbird</code>).
</p><p>The configuration itself is stored in the specified directory, in a file named <code>prefs.js</code>. This is a readable file of javascript commands. All other files in that directory are dynamically created by Mozilla on first start.
Unlike Mozilla's binary registry.dat file, Thunderbird's and Firefox' profiles.ini file is a readable text file. Here is an example of what this may look like:
</p>
<pre>[General]
StartWithLastProfile=1

[Profile0]
Name=default
IsRelative=1
Path=Profiles/default.uda
</pre>
<p>If you want to point this to a location of your choice (for example <code>H:\Thunderbird</code>), you need to perform to changes:
Set IsRelative to be 0 Update the path to point to the desired place. Note: For absolute paths Thunderbird uses Dos'ish backslashes (<code>\</code>) rather than Unixish slashes (<code>/</code>).
You'd obtain a file such as the following:
</p>
<pre>[General]
StartWithLastProfile=1

[Profile0]
Name=default
IsRelative=0
Path=H:\Thunderbird
</pre>
