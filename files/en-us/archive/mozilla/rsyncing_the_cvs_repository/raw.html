<p>The mozilla.org CVS repository can be downloaded via rsync. This is useful for faster diffs or for attempting to import it into another version control system.
</p><p>Here's how to do it:
</p>
<pre class="eval">rsync -az --delete --stats cvs-mirror.mozilla.org::mozilla ~/cvs-mirror
</pre>
<p>This will mirror the CVS repository into ~/cvs-mirror. Optionally, the <code>--progress</code> option will show the progress for each file, and a percentage of the total files that are transferred.
</p><p>At the time of this writing, this will take 2.8 GB of disk space.
</p><p>Note that for using this copy, the NoLocks line in CVSROOT/config will need to be commented out, as it requires a modified CVS binary.
