<p>As of 2004-12-8, it is now possible to automatically handle failed asserts in debug builds of Mozilla for Windows.</p>
<p>The handler receives the assert string, and sequentially attempts to match each word in the string (left to right) to registry DWORD names from <code>HKLM\Software\mozilla.org\windbgdlg</code> and <code>HKCU\Software\mozilla.org\windbgdlg</code>. At the first match, it will take the action specified by the DWORD's value.</p>
<p>The valid values are:</p>
<ul> <li><code>0x5</code> Automatically ignore</li> <li><code>0x4</code> Automatically retry</li> <li><code>0x3</code> Automatically abort</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can also force windbgdlg to prompt, by setting a value of <code>0xfffffffe</code>.</p>
<p>To "comment out" a value, set its value to <code>0xffffffff</code>.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the following failed assertion:</p>
<pre>ASSERTION: no document: 'mDocument != nsnull', file
d:/cvs-1.11.4/mozilla/content/xul/content/src/nsXULElement.cpp, line
3173</pre>
<p>(note that I have my source tree in d:/cvs-1.11.4/mozilla)</p>
<p>If you have a DWORD in <code>HKCU\Software\mozilla.org\windbgdlg\</code> named "d:/cvs-1.11.5/mozilla/content/xul/content/src/nsXULElement.cpp," (WITH the comma - matches are whole-word only) and value <code>0x5</code>, the assert would automatically be ignored. If you also had a DWORD named "3173", it would have no effect here because the handler stops comparing values at the first match.</p>
<p>Note that double quotes which delimit an item (") are ignored in value names and the assertion string, so <code>"silly"</code> and <code>silly</code> will both be matched by a value named <code>silly</code>. <code>"silly",</code> will only be matched by a value named <code>"silly",</code> since the quotes are internal to the string.</p>
