<h2 id="Using_aboutstartup">Using about:startup</h2>

<p>The <a class="link-https" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/about-startup/" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/about-startup/">About Startup add-on</a> provides a much simpler way to measure startup performance. Once installed, it will gather startup data and display it in the <code>about:startup</code> page. The add-on is very lightweight, so it shouldn't have a noticeable negative effect on your baseline and add-on tests.</p>

<p>To test with <code>about:startup</code>, you should set up a new Firefox profile, install this add-on, and then open and quit Firefox repeatedly. If you want to match Talos, you should do this 20 times. Then look at the results in the <code>about:startup</code> page. This should provide your baseline numbers. Then repeat the process with both About Startup and your add-on installed. The overhead can be calculated using the same formula.</p>

<p>The <code>about:startup</code> page shows 3 different time measurements: <em>main</em>, <em>sessionRestored</em> and <em>firstPaint</em>. <em>main</em> happens very early in the startup process and should not be affected by add-ons being installed. The <code>firstPaint</code> time should be roughly similar to what Talos tests. This can vary between systems, though. <code>sessionRestored</code> is fired later in the process, when Firefox has loaded all tabs from the saved session.</p>
