<div class="note">
<p>The term .htaccess stands for "hypertext access". A file with the HTACCESS file extension is an Access Configuration file for apache server. The .htaccess file configures the current directory with things like password protection, URL rewrites &amp; redirects, and more.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>File Accessing</strong> : htaccess files can be opened using any text editor, like Windows Notepad, Vin, Sublime text editor or any other. Syntax highliting support for .htaccess files less.</p>

<h2 id="Common_Application">Common Application</h2>

<p><strong>URL Redirects &amp; rewrite</strong>: htaccess files are often used to redirect traffic to a web page to another or from traffic to a directory to another even between domains is possible. It's a fast and efficient way of redirecting traffic, because the redirect happens before the pages are served. Redirects can be made on a temporary basis or permanently by supplying the status codes.</p>

<pre>Redirect 301 / http://example.com/       # redirect the traffic to the directory to example.com , Permanent Redirect
Redirect 302 / http://example.com/       # redirect the traffic to the directory to example.com , Temporary Redirect
</pre>

<p><strong>Blocking </strong>: htaccess also facilitates blocking traffic based on IP and IP range,  Also, use to block bad bots, rippers, and referrers; often used to restrict access by Search Engine spiders.</p>

<pre>deny from 146.0.74.205                   # Blocks all access from 146.0.74.205 to the directory</pre>

<p><strong>SSI or Server Side Include</strong> : Include external files to each file requested by the user without the need to write include statements in the file; you can have them automatically attached to all the files, whether at top or bottom, automatically through your .htaccess file.</p>

<pre>php_value auto_prepend_file "/real/path/to/file/functions.php" # Adds function.php at the top of requested document
php_value auto_append_file "/real/path/to/file/footer.php" # Adds footer.html at bottom of requested document
</pre>

<p><strong>Customized error responses :</strong> User can be directed to different pages depending on the Error they caused or by the webserver.</p>

<pre>ErrorDocument 404 /notfound.html # Redirects traffic to notfound.html in case of a 404 error
ErrorDocument 500 /serverr.html  # Redirects traffic to serverr.html in case of a 500 internal server error
</pre>

<p><strong>Cache Control : </strong><span style="line-height: 1.572;">.htaccess allows a server to control caching by web browsers, helps load pages faster, and reduces the data transfer.</span></p>
