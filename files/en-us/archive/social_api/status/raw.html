<p>Social Status was added in Firefox 27 and removed in Firefox 51.</p>

<p>A service provider may choose to provide a Social Status button that allows them to provide a notifications style panel in the user's toolbar.  The provider may use the social worker to update the button badge using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Social_API/Service_worker_API_reference">social.ambient-notification</a> API.  The panel otherwise contains an iframe that loads a page from the service provider.</p>

<h3 id="Status_URL">Status URL</h3>

<p>To support the Status button, the provider must include a url in the manifest:</p>

<pre>"statusURL": "https://yoursite.com/status"</pre>

<h3 id="How_to_properly_size_your_status_panel">How to properly size your status panel</h3>

<p>Your status panel is presented in a door hanger from the browser toolbar.  While it can be flexible in size, there is a minimum and a maximum size that the panel will allow.  You also need to implement a couple items to help the browser identify the size you need for your panel.  There are a few ways you can define the proper size for your panel, here are some examples:</p>

<h4 id="Styling_the_BODY_element">Styling the BODY element</h4>

<p>By default the browser will look at the <code>body.style.width</code> and <code>body.style.height</code>, also taking into account the margin.  It will try to size the panel to show your full page.</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body style="width: 300px; height: 400px"&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<h4 id="Identifying_a_content_element">Identifying a content element</h4>

<p>The browser will also look to see if you have defined a primary content element.  If you have, then it will use the width and height styles from that element to size the panel.  You will need to make sure that your content element is properly placed.</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body contentid="content"&gt;
&lt;div id="content" style="width: 300px; height: 400px; top: 0; left: 0;"/&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
