<p>This article describes the lifecycle of a social service worker, how the social service lets the browser interact with a social media site, and so forth.</p>
<h2 id="Lifecycle_of_a_social_service_worker">Lifecycle of a social service worker</h2>
<p>A social service provider is defined by a structured text file (JSON) containing a number of keyed URLs, a name, and an icon. URLs have the same origin as the JSON file if remotely loaded.</p>
<p>A service worker is instantiated from the service worker URL provided by the service provider; this URL should resolve to a JavaScript file that is evaluated by the service worker. The worker is a shared worker, rendered "headlessly," in a style very similar to the <a href="/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers" title="/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers">Web Workers</a> specification (though note that the current implementation is not, in fact, a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker" title="The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker()Â constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread."><code>Worker</code></a>).</p>
<p>The service worker lives until terminated, either by browser shutdown or by an explicit control command from the user.</p>
<p>If the browser determines that termination of the service worker is necessary, all of the service-level content associated with the service worker is unloaded (that is, all <span style="color: #ffff00;"><code><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ServiceWindow</span></code></span>s and sidebars are closed) as part of the termination.</p>
<p>If the browser starts (or restarts) the service during a normal user session, the service worker is fully loaded first, and sidebars are then instantiated on existing windows. <span style="color: #ffff00;"><code><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">ServiceWindow</span></code></span>s (such as chats) are not restarted automatically.</p>
<h2 id="Implementation_flow">Implementation flow</h2>
<p>This section illustrates how the social service is started up, communicates with the social media site, and shuts down.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;add an actual diagram&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<ol>
  <li>The service is registered with a service, sidebar widget, and share widget.</li>
  <li>At browser startup time, the service worker is instantiated.</li>
  <li>The service opens a connection to its service, if a user session is available, and starts receiving push events.</li>
  <li>When a browser window is created, the sidebar widget content is instantiated.</li>
  <li>The sidebar may connect with the background worker by using <code>mozSocial.getWorker().port.postMessage("hello")</code>.</li>
  <li>The service worker catches the "hello" message and adds the <code>sidebarContentWindow</code> to a list of event sinks.</li>
  <li>The sidebar content may then perform more elaborate publish-subscribe handshaking, to limit what events it receives.</li>
  <li>When the service receives events from the server (or from other content), it may communicate those events to any, or all, of the windows by invoking <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage" title="The window.postMessage() method safely enables cross-origin communication. Normally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages that executed them are at locations with the same protocol (usually both https), port number (443 being the default for https), and host (modulo Document.domain being set by both pages to the same value). window.postMessage() provides a controlled mechanism to circumvent this restriction in a way which is secure when properly used."><code>window.postMessage()</code></a> on each window reference.</li>
  <li>If the user clicks in the sidebar to, for example, open a chat window, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozSocial/openChatWindow" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>MozSocial.openChatWindow()</code></a> is called and a new window is created. The chat window registers with the service by using <code>mozSocial.getWorker().postMessage("hello")</code> and receives a message back telling it who to open a chat with. The service might then deliver server-pushed events to the chat window, perhaps through a publish-subscribe system.</li>
</ol>
