<p>Improper browser detection can lead to web maintenance nightmares. Rethinking the basics of when and how to detect user agents is crucial to creating maintainable, cross browser web content. This article reviews several approaches to browser detection, their usefulness in specific circumstances to arrive at a common sense approach to browser detection.</p>

<h3 id="Quick_Tip" name="Quick_Tip">Quick Tip</h3>

<p>If you must determine if a visitor is using a Gecko-based browser, simply test</p>

<p><code>navigator.product == &apos;Gecko&apos;</code></p>

<p>or look for the string <code>&apos;Gecko/&apos;</code> in the <code>navigator.userAgent</code>. Note that some other browsers such as Safari are reporting <code>(like Gecko)</code> in their user agent strings and can confuse simple tests.</p>

<h3 id="Introduction" name="Introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In an <em>ideal</em> world, we could author HTML, XML, CSS and JavaScript and only worry about the W3C and ECMA standards. However, we don&apos;t quite live in such a world yet. Due to bugs, incomplete implementations of the standards and legacy browsers, web developers must be able to determine which browser a visitor is using and provide the appropriate content and scripting code path.</p>

<p>Although browser detection is perhaps the most common scripting task that every web developer faces, it seems that the variety of different strategies in use for detecting browsers is unlimited. As a member of the Netscape Evangelism team who has spent over a year investigating existing web content, I can say without a doubt that most compatibility problems found on the web today are due to a lack of understanding of the standards combined with inadequate and inappropriate browser detection strategies.</p>

<p>This article is intended to provide an overview of browser detection strategies and best practices. For more specific Gecko recommendations, please see the <a href="/en/Gecko_Compatibility_Handbook" title="en/Gecko_Compatibility_Handbook">Gecko Compatibility Handbook</a></p>

<h3 id="Gecko" name="Gecko">Gecko</h3>

<p>Although many web developers are aware of Firefox, Mozilla, and Netscape browsers, far fewer are aware that these browsers are members of an entire family of user agents based upon the <strong>Gecko layout engine</strong> which includes the commercial browser CompuServe 7, and open source browsers such as <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/" class="external">Epiphany</a>, <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/" class="external">Galeon</a>, <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/" class="external">Camino</a>, <a href="http://kmeleon.sourceforge.net/" class="external">Kmeleon</a>, and <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/" class="external">SeaMonkey</a>.</p>

<p>Gecko was designed from the ground up to be compliant with the W3C HTML, W3C CSS, W3C XML, W3C DOM, and ECMAScript (JavaScript) standards. It also includes compatibility features which allow it to reasonably handle <em>legacy</em> content which was developed for earlier generations of browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4 as well as features which provide compatibility with Internet Explorer 5 and 6. Unlike other browsers, Gecko is truly cross platform and provides consistent behavior across all supported operating systems.</p>

<p>The easiest way to support Gecko is to create content which follows web standards. Unfortunately, no other browser supports web standards as completely as Gecko. This means web developers and authors are forced to continue to support other browsers which do not comply with the standards as fully. Fortunately, other browsers such as Opera (versions 7 &amp; later) and to a lesser extent, Internet Explorer (versions 5.5 &amp; later) also support the standards to a degree. These other browsers appear to be moving towards more complete support for the standards and there is hope that in the future web developers and authors will be able to dispense with browser detection at least with regard to features governed by standards.</p>

<p>We are still faced with the question of how to develop standards based content while supporting the differing implementations of modern browsers while at the same time supporting (to a lesser degree) older and less capable browsers. Browser detection is key to accomplishing this task.</p>

<h3 id="Browser_Detection_History_Primer" name="Browser_Detection_History_Primer">Browser Detection History Primer</h3>

<p>To understand why many common browser detection strategies are inappropriate, we must first look back on how these strategies came into being.</p>

<p>In the earliest days of the web, <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/" class="external">HTML</a> was very simple, not standardized and did not include any support for client side scripting. HTML itself was not standardized until HTML 2.0 was introduced in late 1995 and it did not even include tables. Browser vendors such as Netscape and Microsoft competed to add compelling <em>features</em> to the HTML they supported in their browsers in order to provide the richest most compelling content to their users and to entice web authors to support them. The abilities of browsers to support the latest and greatest content changed on an almost daily basis.</p>

<p>Web authors were faced from the beginning with a variety of browsers, some of which supported the latest and greatest version HTML and some which did not. The solution was either to provide the lowest-common denominator of HTML or to use browser detection techniques on the web server to send customized content to each browser depending on what level of support the browser provided. Server side browser detection using user agent strings was born.</p>

<p>User agent strings are defined in the HTTP protocol and are available to web servers (see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945">RFC 1945</a> - Hypertext Transfer Protocol 1.0 and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068">RFC 2068</a> - Hypertext Transfer Protocol 1.1).</p>

<p>The most common approach at this time was to distinguish user agents by <em>vendor</em> and <em>version</em> using the reported user agent string. Although this approach was considered reasonable at the time, this approach caused problems for browser vendors right from the beginning. The original Netscape browsers used a user agent string which began with the code name for the Netscape browser followed by its version number, e.g. <code>Mozilla/version</code> followed by a comment token which gave additional information regarding the operating system being used, etc. Since the earliest browser detection techniques were based upon looking for a Netscape based browser and only provided customized content to browsers which used the <code>Mozilla/version</code> user agent string, other browser vendors standardized on using <code>Mozilla/version</code> to signal that they were compatible with a particular Netscape version. Since other browsers <em>pretended</em> to be Netscape browsers and encoded their version information in a non-standard fashion in the user agent comment area, the task of determining which browser was being used became more complicated than it should have been.</p>

<p>Netscape Navigator 2 introduced the ability to run JavaScript in web browsers. As browser evolution continued, differences in the implementation of scripting and the objects supported by browsers appeared. Web authors were no longer limited to detecting browsers on their web servers, but could now execute scripts client side (in the browser itself) which could be used to distinguish browsers. One of the earliest approaches to client side browser detection involved testing whether the browser supported particular <em>objects</em>. An example of this approach involved testing for the existence of the <code>document.images</code> object.</p>

<p>While <em>object based detection</em> was used in some circumstances, many web authors continued to use the <em>vendor/version</em> approach to distinguishing web browsers in their client side scripts. Since the user agent string was exposed as a property of the <code>navigator</code> object (e.g. <code>navigator.userAgent</code>), many web authors used the same logic in their client side scripts as they had used earlier in their server side browser detection. In addition to <code>navigator.userAgent</code> other properties such as <code>appName</code> and <code>appVersion</code> were available in the <code>navigator</code> object which could be used in browser <em>vendor/version</em> detection strategies.</p>

<p>The classic example of this <em>vendor/version</em> client side detection strategy can be found in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/sniffer/browser_type.html" class="external">Ultimate Browser Sniffer</a>. This script and variants of it can be found today on many web sites where it is a common source of detection problems.</p>

<p>Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4 introduced the ability to manipulate HTML content in a browser (Dynamic HTML or <a href="/en/DHTML" title="en/DHTML">DHTML</a>) rather than on the web server and began the introduction of support for <a href="/en/CSS" title="en/CSS">CSS</a> to style content. This generation of browser, in addition to sharing several features which were not available in earlier versions, each implemented their own (incompatible) competing abilities to manipulate content in a web page.</p>

<p>Since each vendor&apos;s browser implemented different objects to perform DHTML, web authors began to use object detection to distinguish <em>vendor/version</em> through the existence of particular JavaScript objects. The existence of <code>document.layers</code> was sufficient to be sure that the browser was Netscape Navigator 4 while the existence of <code>document.all</code> was sufficient to be sure that the browser was Microsoft Internet Explorer 4. An implicit assumption by many web authors around this time was the there were only two types of browser available... Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>These strategies of classifying browsers by <em>vendor/version</em>, assuming that the only browsers being used where either Netscape Navigator 4 or Internet Explorer 4 <strong>failed</strong> when alternative browsers such as those based upon Gecko were introduced. Many of the problems reported in the press regarding Gecko&apos;s inability to display content were directly related to inadequate, inappropriate browser detection strategies.</p>

<p>A final note on <em>vendor/version</em> strategies. A web developer who fully utilizes the browser detection and distinctions in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/sniffer/browser_type.html" class="external">Ultimate Browser Sniffer</a> will produce code which uses code forks for many browsers and versions. Imagine attempting to maintain a web site which uses many of the browser variables available from the Ultimate Browser Sniffer.</p>

<p><strong>Detecting browsers using this level of detail is unworkable, unmaintainable and violates the basic principles of web authoring!</strong> I strongly advise everyone to avoid this trap.</p>

<h3 id="Problems_caused_by_inappropriate_Browser_Detection" name="Problems_caused_by_inappropriate_Browser_Detection">Problems caused by inappropriate Browser Detection</h3>

<h4 id="Excluding_Unknown_Browsers" name="Excluding_Unknown_Browsers">Excluding Unknown Browsers</h4>

<p>If you only provide tests for specific browsers in your detection logic, your site will not be usable if a visitor uses a different browser. Consider the following example:</p>

<p> </p>

<pre>// WRONG APPROACH - do not use!
if (document.all)
{
// Internet Explorer 4+
document.write(&apos;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; src=&quot;style-ie.css&quot;&gt;&apos;);
}
else if (document.layers)
{
// Navigator 4
document.write(&apos;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; src=&quot;style-nn.css&quot;&gt;&apos;);
}
</pre>

<p>Note how the above example only provided stylesheets for Internet Explorer and Navigator 4 and even then only if the visitor has JavaScript support turned on in their browser. Users of Netscape 6, Netscape 7, CompuServe 7, Mozilla, Opera will not be able to view the site properly.</p>

<h4 id="Misidentifying_Browsers" name="Misidentifying_Browsers">Misidentifying Browsers</h4>

<p>A common mistake web authors make is to assume that if a browser is not Netscape Navigator 4, it must be Internet Explorer and vice versa. For example:</p>

<pre>// WRONG APPROACH - do not use!
if (document.all)
{
  // Internet Explorer 4+
  elm = document.all[&apos;menu&apos;];
}
else
{
  // Assume Navigator 4
  elm = document.layers[&apos;menu&apos;];
}
</pre>

<p>Note how the above example assumed that any browser that was not Internet Explorer was Navigator 4 and attempted to use <em>Layers</em>. This is a common source of problems when using browsers based upon Gecko as well as Opera. A similar error can be seen in the following example:</p>

<pre>// WRONG APPROACH - do not use!
if (document.layers)
{
  // Navigator 4
  elm = document.layers[&apos;menu&apos;];
}
else
{
  // Assume Internet Explorer 4+
  elm = document.all[&apos;menu&apos;];
}
</pre>

<p>Netscape 6 was the first commercial browser released based upon Gecko. Due to a lack of communication and understanding, many sites have created inappropriate detection strategies based upon the Netscape 6 user agent string. Netscape 6&apos;s user agent string follows the HTTP standards for specifying the version of the user agent. (see <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/revised-user-agent-strings.html" class="external">Mozilla user-agent strings</a> and <a href="/en/Gecko_User_Agent_Strings" title="en/Gecko_User_Agent_Strings">Gecko User Agent Strings</a>)</p>

<pre class="eval">Mozilla/5.0 (...) Gecko/20001108 Netscape6/6.0
</pre>

<p>The first vendor/version (Mozilla/5.0) indicates that Netscape 6 is a <em>fifth</em> generation browser and is not identical to earlier browsers. All Gecko based browsers currently report Mozilla/5.0 as their primary version although no other browser does so at the moment. Hopefully when other browser vendors achieve the same level of standards support as Gecko and begin to drop support for legacy browsers, they too will begin to report version 5. Assuming that only Gecko will use Mozilla/5.0 will cause your browser detection logic to fail as soon as another browser vendor releases a browser which reports Mozilla/5.0.</p>

<p>The second vendor/version (Gecko/20001108) identifies Netscape 6 as a particular release of Gecko which was built on November 8, 2000. If you must detect Gecko using the user agent string, Gecko/CCYYMMDD is the most appropriate string to search for.</p>

<p>The third vendor/version (Netscape6/6.0) identifies this particular instance of a Gecko browser as Netscape 6.0. Many sites keyed off of the existence of the string Netscape6 in the user agent and used tests similar to:</p>

<pre>if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf(&apos;Netscape6&apos;) != -1)
{
  // Netscape 6 code
}
</pre>

<p>Note how this type of detection misses any other Gecko based browser. Unfortunately, the Netscape 6 user agent string was not sufficiently generalizable due to it&apos;s use of the string Netscape6 as a description of the vendor. Netscape 7 corrects this error and introduces another chance for user agent string based detection to fail.</p>

<pre class="eval">Mozilla/5.0 (...) Gecko/200207XX Netscape/7.0
</pre>

<p>Note how Netscape 7 no longer uses the string Netscape6 as the Vendor. Any user agent string detection strategy for Gecko based upon the existence of the string Netscape6 will fail to detect Netscape 7.</p>

<h4 id="Using_JavaScript_Objects_to_Determine_vendor.2Fversion" name="Using_JavaScript_Objects_to_Determine_vendor.2Fversion">Using JavaScript Objects to Determine <em>vendor/version</em></h4>

<p>As we already discussed, a common approach in the past was to use objects to classify browsers by <em>vendor/version</em>. A common type of detection which originally was written to support only Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4 might look like:</p>

<pre>// WRONG APPROACH - do not use!
if (document.all)
{
  // IE4
  height = document.body.offsetHeight;
}
else if (document.layers)
{
  // NN4
  height = window.innerHeight;
}
else
{
  // other
  height = 0;
}
</pre>

<p>With the introduction of the W3C DOM, the standard method <code>document.getElementById</code> became available in Internet Explorer 5 and later in Netscape 6 (Gecko). Many web authors decided that the easiest way to add support for Netscape Gecko was to add another code fork as follows:</p>

<pre>// WRONG APPROACH - do not use!
if (document.all)
{
  // IE4
  height = document.body.offsetHeight;
}
else if (document.layers)
{
  // NN4
  height = window.innerHeight;
}
else if (document.getElementById)
{
  // They think this is Gecko
  // but could be wrong!
  height = window.innerHeight;
}
else
{
  // other
  height = 0;
}
</pre>

<p>The approach is incorrect since it assumes that the only other browser besides Internet Explorer 5+ that implements <code>document.getElementById</code> is Gecko. This is not true today and will become even less true as more browsers which support the W3C DOM Standards are introduced in the future.</p>

<h3 id="Recommendations" name="Recommendations">Recommendations</h3>

<h4 id="Target_the_standards_and_not_particular_browsers" name="Target_the_standards_and_not_particular_browsers">Target the standards and not particular browsers</h4>

<p>While the period from 1994-2000 was dominated by incompatible non-standard browsers from Netscape and Microsoft, today the dominating factor in web development are the standards proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium <a href="http://www.w3.org/" class="external">(W3C)</a>. Standards are important for web developers due to the increased flexibility, power of presentation, support for users with disabilities to name just a few reasons.</p>

<p>Targeting your web content to particular vendors ignores the possibility that other browsers which support the same standards may be introduced in the future. A common problem on the web today is the assumption that the only browsers in the world are Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. This ignores the existence of <a href="http://www.opera.com" class="external">Opera</a> as well as the newer handheld devices which are being used to access the web today and in the future.</p>

<p>Mozilla-based browsers (such as Firefox), <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnie60/html/cssenhancements.asp" class="external">Internet Explorer 6</a> on Windows, and Internet Explorer 5 for Macintosh all support <em>DOCTYPE switching</em>. This is a technique where these browsers can be switched from <a href="/en/Mozilla&apos;s_Quirks_Mode" title="en/Mozilla&apos;s_Quirks_Mode">&quot;Quirks&quot; mode</a> (which emulates buggy implementations in earlier generation browsers) to Standards mode (which more strictly adhers to the Standards). For new content, we recommend that you use a DOCTYPE which will invoke Standards mode in Gecko and Internet Explorer 6. This will ensure that your designs work similarly in these browsers as well as in any other browsers which support the Standards.</p>

<h4 id="Provide_support_for_unknown_browsers" name="Provide_support_for_unknown_browsers">Provide support for unknown browsers</h4>

<p>Always provide content and code paths for unknown browsers. The recommended approach is to assume that any unknown browser supports the basic standards of HTML and CSS and to a certain extent JavaScript and the W3C DOM. This will guarantee that your content will be supported today and in the future by <strong>any</strong> browser which supports the standards.</p>

<h4 id="Limit_the_use_of_vendor.2Fversion_specific_features" name="Limit_the_use_of_vendor.2Fversion_specific_features">Limit the use of vendor/version specific features</h4>

<p>Authoring content which is standards compliant is the easiest way to support the widest range of user agents and to decrease your maintenance costs. While it is not always possible to avoid <em>vendor/version</em> specific differences between browsers, the use of such features and the distinction between browsers based on <em>vendor/version</em> should be strictly limited to those areas where it is still required.</p>

<h4 id="Limit_the_use_of_User_Agent_String_based_Detection" name="Limit_the_use_of_User_Agent_String_based_Detection">Limit the use of User Agent String based Detection</h4>

<p>Server side browser detection requires the use of user agent strings. We recommend that the use of user agent string based detection be limited to server side situations and except in those circumstances where it is absolutely required such as when details of the Gecko branch are required.</p>

<p>There are <strong>legitimate</strong> reasons to use the user agent string (or the <code>navigator</code> object) to determine exactly what vendor, version or operating system is being used. Many financial sites (banks, online stock trading firms, etc) have very strict policies with respect to what browsers they support. This is due to the history of security exploits that have been discovered in older browsers. If you have the need to only allow specific versions of browsers to use your secure site, then the user agent string and the related information from the <code>navigator</code> object can be very useful.</p>

<p>You can also use detailed information regarding a browser&apos;s version to work around bugs in specific releases of a browser. However, this can quickly become a maintenance nightmare if you are not careful. I recommend that you only provide work arounds for bugs on a temporary basis and as soon as bugs are corrected in newer releases of the browser that you require your visitors to upgrade their browser.</p>

<h4 id="Provide_downlevel_pages_for_older_browsers" name="Provide_downlevel_pages_for_older_browsers">Provide downlevel pages for older browsers</h4>

<p>No commercial web site today makes complete support for Netscape Navigator versions 1, 2 or 3 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 a requirement. The reasons are that the capabilities of such browsers are far too limited compared to more modern browsers, the added development and quality assurance requirements add too much to the development cost of web sites and the market share of such browsers does not justify the expense of supporting them.</p>

<p>One of the most important decisions you can make in order to improve the quality of your site and decrease development, maintenance and quality assurance costs is to provide only limited support for older browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4. One of the more common approaches in major web sites is to provide a downlevel version of a web page to older browsers while providing a richer page which uses advanced CSS and JavaScript to more modern browsers. This can be accomplished through server side browser detection either as part of a scripted solution or as part of the web server&apos;s native ability to serve different content to different user agents. This approach does not necessarily require you to author separate pages for downlevel and modern browsers. A common solution is to author content in a neutral format such as XML and use XSLT transformations to generate the necessary HTML for each class of browser.</p>

<p>Whether a particular browser should be provided with downlevel content depends to an extent on what features of CSS or JavaScript are being used in the advanced content. Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4 should both be considered downlevel browsers for most pages due to their limited support for CSS and the more recent DOM based standards. If your pages make use of advanced JavaScript which manipulates or creates new content using the W3C DOM Core, then Opera 5 and 6 should be considered downlevel as well due to their limited support for the W3C DOM.</p>

<p>The future belongs to developers and browsers which support standards. If you fail to take advantage of the coming change in browsers, your competitors will eat your lunch. Once that happens, the only place your web site will be found is on the <a href="http://web.archive.org" class="external">web archive</a>.</p>

<h4 id="Use_non-script_based_detection_methods_where_possible" name="Use_non-script_based_detection_methods_where_possible">Use non-script based detection methods where possible</h4>

<p>Older browsers have many limitations which result in their ignoring more advanced features. By judiciously using these limitations in older browsers you can include modern content while at the same time supporting older browsers.</p>

<p>HTML provides several methods of detecting support for various features such as support for scripting and FRAMES. Use these natural abilities of HTML to extend the range of browsers your content supports.</p>

</pre>

<h4 id="Using_NOSCRIPT_to_support_non-scriptable_browsers" name="Using_NOSCRIPT_to_support_non-scriptable_browsers">Using NOSCRIPT to support non-scriptable browsers</h4>

<p>Some browsers may not support scripting while some users may have scripting support turned off in their browser. Use the NOSCRIPT tag to provide these users with alternative unscripted versions of your pages or to at least notify them of the need to use scripting in order to view your content properly.</p>

<p>Since browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4 do not support some of the most recent additions to the JavaScript (ECMAScript) standard, it is often necessary to limit the use of advanced JavaScript features such as <em>exception</em> processing. One approach is to require that users of browsers which do not support the level of JavaScript used in your content to <strong>turn off</strong> JavaScript in order to be able to use your content. You can do this by providing an error message for users of older browsers as well as alternative content contained in NOSCRIPT tags.</p>

<pre>&lt;HTML&gt;
  &lt;HEAD&gt;
    &lt;TITLE&gt;NOSCRIPT&lt;/TITLE&gt;
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;
  &lt;BODY&gt;
    &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
      window.onerror = function ()
      {
        // redirect user to a page describing the limitations
        // of their browser and requesting that they turn off
        // JavaScript in order to view your site.
      }

      // Netscape Navigator 4 will throw an error
      // on any JavaScript which attempts to use
      // try ... catch exception processing.
      try
      {
        // Code to implement fancy Menu
      }
      catch (errors)
      {
        // handle Exceptions
      }
    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
    &lt;NOSCRIPT&gt;
      &lt;!--
      if javascript is not enabled, then the browser
      will display the contents of the NOSCRIPT tag
      which in this case is a simple MENU implemented
      as an unordered list.
      --&gt;
      &lt;UL&gt;
        &lt;LI&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;choice1.html&quot;&gt;Choice1&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
        &lt;LI&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;choice2.html&quot;&gt;Choice2&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
      &lt;/UL&gt;
    &lt;/NOSCRIPT&gt;
  &lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>

<h4 id="Using_SCRIPT_LANGUAGE_to_choose_the_browser_where_it_will_be_executed" name="Using_SCRIPT_LANGUAGE_to_choose_the_browser_where_it_will_be_executed">Using SCRIPT LANGUAGE to choose the browser where it will be executed</h4>

<p>The choice of scripting language is determined by the LANGUAGE attribute of the script tag. Internet Explorer 4 and above can support a variety of script languages. The most common are <em>VBSCRIPT</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>. Internet Explorer also uses <em>JSCRIPT</em> as a synonym for JavaScript. Since other browsers do not support the language attribute <em>VBSCRIPT</em> or <em>JSCRIPT</em> you can use these languages when you wish certain scripts to only be executed by Internet Explorer 4 and above.</p>

<h4 id="Using_Netscape_Navigator_4.27s_CSS_limitations" name="Using_Netscape_Navigator_4.27s_CSS_limitations">Using Netscape Navigator 4&apos;s CSS limitations</h4>

<p>It is possible to use Netscape Navigator 4&apos;s limitations for CSS support to automatically exclude certain CSS rules from ever being seen by Navigator 4.</p>

<p>For example, Navigator 4 does not understand the @import directive in CSS and will not load any external CSS Style sheets specified via @import. This technique can be used to provide basic common CSS rules for all browsers (including Navigator 4) while providing more advanced rules in a external CSS file for more modern CSS compliant browsers.</p>

<pre>&lt;STYLE type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
/* Navigator 4 CSS rules */
&lt;/STYLE&gt;

&lt;STYLE type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
/* Advanced CSS rules ignored by Navigator 4 */
@import &quot;advanced.css&quot;;
&lt;/STYLE&gt;
</pre>

<p>A similar technique is available for hiding CSS rules from Navigator 4 using the fact that Navigator 4 will ignore CSS rules after an occurence of /*/*/ in a stylesheet.</p>

<pre>&lt;STYLE type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
/* Navigator 4 CSS rules */

/*/*/
/* Advanced CSS rules ignored by Navigator 4 */
&lt;/STYLE&gt;
</pre>

<p>DevEdge uses this technique to hide advanced CSS from Navigator 4.</p>

<h4 id="Use_feature_oriented_object_detection" name="Use_feature_oriented_object_detection">Use feature oriented object detection</h4>

<p>Object detection is a powerful method of providing cross browser support in your web content. Although you can use object detection as just another means of distinguishing between vendor/version the technique shows it&apos;s true power when used to detect features rather than browsers.</p>

<p>Feature oriented object detection is the testing for the existence of specific objects before attempting to use them in a script. The classic example is:</p>

<pre>if (document.images)
{
  // code which processes the images
}
</pre>

<p>The advantage to feature detection is that it will work regardless of the vendor/version. We can rewrite the earlier example which illustrated problems with using objects to determine vendor/version to use feature detection instead.</p>

<pre>if (document.body &amp;&amp; typeof(document.body.offsetHeight) == &apos;number&apos;)
{
  height = document.body.offsetHeight;
}
else if (typeof(window.innerHeight) == &apos;number&apos;)
{
  height = window.innerHeight;
}
else
{
  height = 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Note how the previous example does not make assumptions about which browser is being used. Instead, it only tests for the objects which it wishes to use. Since the numeric values could potentially be zero, the script tests the type of the objects to make sure they are numbers instead.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="Gecko_and_Navigator_4" name="Gecko_and_Navigator_4">Gecko and Navigator 4</h3>

<p>Gecko is the replacement for Navigator 4 rendering engine and as such retains many features from Navigator 4. The basic differences between Navigator 4 and Gecko can be easily summarized by:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Gecko is standards conformant</strong>. Gecko supports many more standards than Navigator 4 and implements them correctly unlike Navigator 4.</li>
 <li><strong>Gecko does not support Layers</strong>. Navigator 4 introduced the Layer API which it used to manipulate content and which formed the basis of DHTML in Navigator 4. Layers however were not accepted by the W3C either in HTML or in the DOM. Since Gecko&apos;s mission was to be the most standards conformant browser possible, Layers were not supported. This lack of backwards compatibility has been the cause of many problems for web authors, but can easily be overcome through proper authoring and browser detection strategies. As the use of Navigator 4 decreases and more authors use the standards in their content, Layers and the problems they cause will disappear.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Gecko_and_Internet_Explorer" name="Gecko_and_Internet_Explorer">Gecko and Internet Explorer</h3>

<p>Gecko implements a number of Internet Explorer only proprietary features especially with respect to their <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/" class="external">DHTML object model</a>. Gecko&apos;s support for a number of IE&apos;s features has steadily increased since the introduction of Netscape 6 in November 2000. The best approach to take advantage of these IE compatibility features in Gecko is to use object based feature detection. This will automatically use any such features in Gecko if they are available in the version of Gecko being used. See the <a href="/en/DOM_Client_Object_Cross-Reference" title="en/DOM_Client_Object_Cross-Reference">DOM Client Object Cross-Reference</a> for more details on which Internet Explorer&apos;s objects and properties are supported by which version of Gecko.</p>

<p>A number of Internet Explorer features <strong>are not supported by Gecko</strong>. These include the <code>window.event</code> object, behaviors, filters, transitions, and ActiveX.</p>

<h3 id="How_.28and_when.29_to_use_the_navigator_object_when_detecting_Gecko" name="How_.28and_when.29_to_use_the_navigator_object_when_detecting_Gecko">How (and when) to use the navigator object when detecting Gecko</h3>

<p>Unless you specifically need to detect if Gecko is being used, do not use these methods. These methods should only be used in circumstances which can not be handled by using <em>object feature detection</em> such as when specific versions of Gecko must be excluded for security reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For client side detection, we recommend using the <code>navigator</code> object and it&apos;s properties. All of the information reported in the <code>navigator</code> is also available in the user agent string which can be used in server side situations.</p>

<h4 id="Product" name="Product">Product</h4>

<p><code>navigator.product</code> is specific to Gecko browsers and will always return &apos;Gecko&apos;. The is a quick and simple means of determining that a browser is based upon Gecko.</p>

<h4 id="CVS_Branch_Tag" name="CVS_Branch_Tag">CVS Branch Tag</h4>

<p>Beginning in Gecko 0.9.0 (Netscape 6.1 in Gecko 0.9.2), <code>navigator.userAgent</code> contains the CVS branch tag of the source which was used to create the version of Gecko being used in the browser. The branch tag is contained in the comment area of the user agent string and follows the string &apos;rv:&apos;. In the following example, the branch tag is a.b.c.</p>

<pre class="eval">Mozilla/5.0 (...; rv:a.b.c) Gecko/CCYYMMDD Vendor/version
</pre>

<p>Gecko browsers which are built from the same branch share the same basic version of Gecko and can be treated similarly when dealing with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. For example, Netscape 6.2, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.3 and CompuServe 7 are all built from the 0.9.4 branch and therefore share similar behavior in many ways.</p>

   <td>Netscape 7.01</td>
   <td>1.0.2</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>As you can see, all versions of Netscape 6.2 and CompuServe 7 were created from the 0.9.4 branch. The distinction between 0.9.4, 0.9.4.1, 0.9.4.2 is minor.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The branch tag is a string and can contain more than single digits in any particular level. For example, it is conceivable that someday there will exist branch tags similar to 2.2.0 and 2.12.36. Since these values are strings, it is not possible to use relative string comparisons to determine which branch tag came later. In our example, branch 2.2.0 was created before 2.12.36 however comparing these values as strings shows &apos;2.2.0&apos; &gt; &apos;2.12.36&apos;. The JavaScript function geckoGetRv() provides one solution to this problem by converting the branch tag in the user agent string into a floating point number where each level of the branch tag is considered as a number from 0-99.</p>

<p>geckoGetRv() returns values which can be compared using greater than, less than, etc. geckoGetRv() is not an official part of Gecko however is provided as an example of approaches you can take to compare the different branch tags today and in the future.</p>

<h4 id="Build_Date" name="Build_Date">Build Date</h4>

<p><code>navigator.productSub</code> is specific to Gecko browsers and will return a string containing the date the browser was built in the format CCYYMMDD (e.g. &apos;20020801&apos; for August 1, 2002). If you are concerned about a specific security issue in Gecko and know for example that all Gecko browsers contain a fix for the issue after a certain date, you can check that the <code>navigator.productSub</code> value is after that date.</p>

<p>You can also distinquish between point releases using a combination of the branch tag and the build date. For example, Netscape 6.2.2 and Netscape 6.2.3 both have branch tags 0.9.4.1, but Netscape 6.2.2 has <code>navigator.productSub == &apos;20020314&apos;</code> while Netscape 6.2.3 has <code>navigator.productSub == &apos;20020508&apos;</code>.</p>

<h4 id="vendor.2Fversion" name="vendor.2Fversion">vendor/version</h4>

<p>All Gecko browsers report the vendor and vendor&apos;s version both in the <code>navigator</code> object and the user agent string. The vendor and version information is not as useful as the branch tag and the build date however and we do not recommend their use. However, if you wish, you can distinguish the different types of Gecko browser using these values. As we saw earlier, the vendor/version appear in the user agent string following the Gecko version.</p>

<pre class="eval">Mozilla/5.0 (...; rv:a.b.c) Gecko/CCYYMMDD Vendor/version
</pre>

<p>The vendor is available in the <code>navigator</code> object as <code>navigator.vendor</code> while the vendor&apos;s version is available as <code>navigator.vendorSub</code>.</p>

<h4 id="Example_1_-_object_based_feature_detection" name="Example_1_-_object_based_feature_detection">Example 1 - object based feature detection</h4>

<p>This example illustrates the use of <em>feature detection</em>. Note that Gecko 1.0 (Netscape 7) and later implement the proprietary Internet Explorer feature clientWidth while Netscape 6 did not. In this example, Netscape 7 and Internet Explorer 5+ will automatically use clientWidth while Netscape Navigator 4, Netscape 6, CompuServe 7 <em>and Opera</em> will use innerWidth.</p>

<p>Compare how you would have had to code this using <em>vendor/version</em> based detection approaches.</p>

<h3 id="Conclusion" name="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>As we have seen in this article, the browser detection story is still quite complicated due to differences between the modern browsers such as Gecko/Internet Explorer 6 and the older or non-standard browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4. You may say to yourself &quot;If only all browsers were as good as Gecko and Internet Explorer 6, then my job would be so much easier!&quot;.</p>

<p>I would like to leave you with this thought. In the past, users did not have the choice of picking a browser which implemented the standards however today they do have a choice. There is no compelling reason for anyone in the world to continue to use a browser which does not support the standards. However, as long as web developers continue to code work arounds for these older browsers, users will not have a compelling reason to upgrade. By ceasing to support older browsers, you can provide a reason for users to upgrade. This will benefit not only them, but yourself as well. Supporting <strong>only standards based browsers</strong> can reduce development and maintanance costs as well as increase the <em>dynamic and compelling content</em> which will attract visitors and increase your revenue. The choice is yours... <strong>Decide to support the standards today!</strong></p>
