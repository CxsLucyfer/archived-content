<h3 id="Inheritance_and_Private_Variables"> Inheritance and Private Variables </h3>
<p>The guide section links to an interesting document discussing how to create and use private variables in objects, which is great if you want to protect the various properties within an object from being poked at accidentally. I also just read a document on proper inheritance using apply(). Well if you combine the two, you can have inherited private variables:
</p>
<pre>function MyClass(){
    var property = 5;
    this.tellMe = function(){ return property; }
}

function MyOtherClass(){
    MyClass.apply( this );
}

var o = new MyOtherClass;
alert( o.tellMe() ); //alerts 5 as you'd expect
</pre>

<h3 id="Terminology"> Terminology </h3>
<p>We need a terminology appendix. For example, "script" and "program" are synonymous. So are "current object" and "context object". We could also put in layman definitions there for JS constructs like functions and variables. --<a>Maian</a> 01:43, 30 September 2005 (PDT)

<h3 id="JS_1.2_and_Gecko_1.8"> JS 1.2 and Gecko 1.8 </h3>
<p>Per the fix for <a class="link-https" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255895">bug 255895</a>, "JavaScript1.2" values for the script's language attribute no longer work, e.g. <code>&lt;script language="JavaScript1.2"&gt;</code> will execute the script in the latest JS version rather than JS 1.2.
</p><p>So how should this be documented? In Fx 1.0, JS 1.2 is available, but not in the upcoming Fx 1.5. There are 5 cases where "JavaScript1.2" is mentioned in this reference: <a>Special:Search?search=JavaScript1.2&amp;go=Go</a>. How should they be revised?

<dl><dd> I think we need a new section in the reference that specifies the differences between versions, collecting this information into a single location rather than leaving it scattered haphazardly throughout the reference as it currently is. Once that is done, the various code samples should be updated to reflect current practices and code if they cannot be written in a "version-neutral" manner. Do you think this makes sense? -- <a>dria</a> 04:27, 22 September 2005 (PDT)

<dl><dd><dl><dd> Those examples are not "bad examples" per se. They are there specifically to show the differences between the two versions.

<h3 id="Object_and_Function_Relation"> Object and Function Relation </h3>
<p>here is my problem , it has been breaking my head for quite some time now. i'm very confused about the way Function and Object in the JavaScript core are related</p>
<p>at first i thought it was something like this :<br> <img alt="Image:jscore.jpg">
</p>
<h4 id="Function_->_Object_->_instance">Function -&gt; Object -&gt; instance</h4>
<p>instance is for example the Math Object, it behaves same way as creating new Object.</p>
<p>i checked this by doing </p>
<pre>alert(Math.constructor)			//shows that Object is its constructor
alert(Object.constructor)			//shows that Function is its constructor
alert(Function.constructor)		//shows that Function is its constructor
</pre>
<p>note : the Function.constructor seems to keep on refering to itself, if you do the following you get same results<br>
which suggests that this is indeed the top level object. </p>
<pre>alert(Function.constructor.constructor)
alert(Function.constructor.constructor.constructor.constructor)</pre>
<h4 id="Function_Object"> Function == Object</h4>
<p>However the following statement suggests that Function IS Object.<br>
But when we create a prototype method for Object its also available in Function </p>
<pre>Object.prototype.myfunction = function() {};
alert(Object.myfunction);		//available in Object
alert(Function.myfunction);		//available in Function
</pre>
<p>also the opposite is correct, when we create a prototype method for Function it is available in Object </p>
<pre>Function.prototype.myfunction = function() {};
alert(Object.myfunction);		//available in Object
alert(Function.myfunction);		//available in Function
</pre>
<p>So no matter what we prototype Function or Object , it will be available in both... &lt;p&gt;So all this now suggests that Function IS Object.</p>
<p>Note that instances derived from function/object also have this function when doing this. </p>
<pre>alert(Array.myfunction);		//available in Array</pre>
<p>(Array cannot be prototyped)</p>
<h4 id="Object_->_Function_->_instance">Object -&gt; Function -&gt; instance</h4>
<p><br>
But there is another but...
</p><p>now if we create a prototype for Object , and create instances of Function and Object we still see that
the functions are still available in both instances. which still suggests that Function IS Object </p>
<pre>Object.prototype.myfunction = function() {};
o = new Function();
alert(o.myfunction);		//available in Function
o = new Object();
alert(o.myfunction);		//available in Object
</pre>
<p><br>
But the following statement is again quite shocking to all the above<br>
if we create a prototype method for Function , and create instances of Function and Object
it shows that the method is only available in Function.
</p>
<pre>Function.prototype.myfunction = function() {};
o = new Function();
alert(o.myfunction);		//available in Function
o = new Object();
alert(o.myfunction);		//not available in Object
</pre>
<p>which again suggests that Object IS NOT function. wich means that Object actually doesn't inherit from Function , but Function inherits from Object which is exactly the oppisite as my first thought (see picture above).<br> i say this because now the function is not available in object, as if the inheritance is :<br> <strong>Object-&gt;Function-&gt;instance</strong></p>
<p>but... while also holding in account the previous example where it was avalable in both instances when prototyping Object it should be : <br> <strong>Function-&gt;Object-&gt;instance</strong><br> or<br> <strong>(Function=Object)-&gt;instance</strong><br> <br> and ofcourse Function == Object return false ;) and the following statements also tells me that Function == Object
although Math is only an instance of Object... which basicly says Function != Object </p>
<pre>alert(Function instanceof Object)		//true
alert(Object instanceof Function)		//true
alert(Math instanceof Object)			//true
alert(Math instanceof Function)			//false
</pre>
<p>note that the Methods and properties for Object in this reference are also available for Function and vice versa ...</p>
<h4 id="Actual_Question"> Actual Question </h4>
<p> so my question is , what the heck is going on here ... </p>
<p>IS Function same as Object. is Function an instance of Object or is Object an instace of Function ? </p>
<p>note that the Methods and properties for Object in this reference are also available for Function and vice versa ...
</p><p>--<a>Aaike82</a> 18:54, 18 August 2006 (PDT)
</p>
<dl><dd>Actual Answer: Object &gt; (Function, everything else). Everything in JavaScript is descended from Object, including functions. All functions in JavaScript (that is, every object that has an internal <span>[[Call]]</span> or <span>[[Construct]]</span> property) are functions as well as objects (including the Function object itself). The reason <code>Object instanceof Function</code> evaluates to <code>true</code> is because Object can be used as a <i>constructor function</i>. A subset of the "Object &gt; (Function, everything else)" chain could be Object &gt; Function &gt; (Object, Function, Array, String, Boolean, Number, Date, RegExp, Error). Array, for example, as a constructor function is an instance of the Function object, which happens to be an instance of Object; therefore, Array is also an instance of Object. This makes sense. The confusion sets in when you consider that Object is also a constructor function, therefore an instance of Function, and, furthermore, an instance of Object; this is where the recursion is introduced, and why you can infinitely do
</dd></dl>
<blockquote><pre>Function.constructor;                                                        //Function
Function.constructor.constructor;                                            //Function
. . .
Function.constructor.constructor.constructor.constructor.constructor . . . ; //Function
</pre></blockquote>
<dl><dd>Note that Math is not a constructor function, but merely a global object with methods and properties useful to perform various mathematical operations. This is why <code>Math instanceof Object</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>, but <code>Math instanceof Function</code> does not. Compare this to the Date object. Like Math, Date is a global object that contains useful methods (<code>Date.parse()</code> and <code>Date.UTC()</code>). In addition to this, however, Date is also a constructor function: it constructs objects of the class Date, and thus is an instance of both Object and Function, whereas Math is merely an instanceof Object. --<a>Sevenspade</a> 14:23, 17 January 2007 (PST)

<p>Yes, seeing stuff that doesn't apply to 1.5 on a page titled "... JavaScript 1.5" might be a little confusing.
But there is no other place to put JavaScript 1.6 features at the moment.
(There is no "Core JavaScript 1.6 Reference" yet.)
</p><p>What should we do, that will be the most useful to our readers?
</p>
<ul><li> Copy all the "... JavaScript 1.5 ..." pages to "... JavaScript 1.6 ..." ? Then carefully update all links to the JavaScript 1.5 pages to link to the JavaScript 1.6 pages -- unless the links are specifically about JavaScript 1.5 ? Then do it all over again when JavaScript 1.7, JavaScript 2.0, JavaScript XXXXII.1, etc. comes out ?
</li><li> Make a footnote on each page, pointing to a page listing "Hot New JavaScript Features", which in turn points to 1 page for 1.6, 1 page for 1.7, etc., listing all the differences from one version to the next ? This would be the simplest thing for us to write. But someone trying write some JavaScript 2.0, wanting a list of all the features it supports, might be annoyed at having to read through *all* the updates.
</li><li> Make a footnote on each page, pointing to a page listing "Hot New JavaScript Features", which lists all the differences between the current latest version, and the documented 1.5 version ? (Every time a new version comes out, a few more things are added to that page).
</li></ul>
<p>None of those options appeal to me. What is the Right Way to write about the latest JavaScript version?
