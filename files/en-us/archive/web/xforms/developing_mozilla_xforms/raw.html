<h2 id="Debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>Always start with a debug build of the xforms and the schema-validation extensions. See <a href="/en/XForms/Building_Mozilla_XForms" title="en/XForms/Building Mozilla XForms">Building Mozilla XForms</a> for a<code> .mozconfig</code> for debug builds. You should create a new, clean profile for debugging. Then start Firefox out of the build directory:</p>
<pre>cd obj-*/dist/firefox
./firefox -no-remote -jsconsole -P <em>yourProfileName</em></pre>
<p>The XForms extension that was built together with Firefox should be already installed.</p>
<p>Then open your form that causes problems and have a look on the console. Often you'll find the first starting points here or in the Error Console.</p>
<h3 id="Schema_validation_problems">Schema validation problems</h3>
<p>The schema-validation extension contains a logging facility that can show some internals on the schema processing. To activate this logging output, set the <code><code>NSPR_LOG_MODULES</code></code> environment variable:</p>
<pre>export NSPR_LOG_MODULES=schemaValidation:5</pre>
<p>This only works on a debug build as described above.</p>
