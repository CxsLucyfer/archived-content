<p>If you have a custom control that you believe will help fulfill the needs of form authors or other custom controls authors, please file it here. This page could be of particular interest to people using custom controls in XUL documents for the following reason. XUL, in many cases, is much better suited for application development than XHTML. Therefore the control set may need to be more extensive to address the wider spectrum of requirements that a XUL application will have on its controls. Note: XUL is a feature of Mozilla only and custom control authors should be aware their controls won't work on other browser platforms.
