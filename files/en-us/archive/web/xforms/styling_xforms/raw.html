<p>The Mozilla XForms extension is one of the few XForms processors which allow for styling of the XForms elements directly, using <a href="en/XForms/Mozilla_XForms_Specials">mostly</a> standard CSS. </p><p>Processors such as <a class="external" href="http://chiba.sourceforge.net/">Chiba</a> create "old-style" HTML forms from XForms documents, and must be styled accordingly. However, most of the time the transition is straight-forward: View the source after processing of your XForms document, and map the old styles to the new elements.
</p><p>Appearance attributes can also make a big difference. Experimenting with these can give you some easier way of styling the contents than just using the default.
</p><p><span class="comment">=== Example === Here's a small example that shows equivalent styles for Chiba and Mozilla XForms. XForms: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; Chiba HTML: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; Mozilla CSS: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; Chiba CSS: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; formsPlayer CSS: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
