<p>Ok, in the end I didn't remove the old code as it isn't hosted anywhere (I thought the github reference contained the code) but inserted a faster implementation above while retaining the rest of the document.</p>
<p>Feel free to alter the text as English is not my mother tongue and I'm more concerned with the code quality that the English grammar ;-S</p>

<p>The Compatibility section goes to extraordinary lengths in providing a forEach implementation. A much more sane approach would be to count on the implementation to throw errors if wrong arguments are provided and implement this in fewer lines of code.</p>
<p>I've removed the lengthy example, while still linking to it and provided a much simpler and leaner implementation.</p>

<p>There is some mistype in <code>Array.prototype.forEach</code>:</p>
<p><code>kValue = O[ Pk ];</code> should be <code>kValue = O[ k ];</code></p>

<p>Is this a from _core_ of JavaScript 1.5? If so, is JS 1.5 Gecko only? Those extra features like forEach are Gecko only, and it should be mentioned that they should *_not_* be used on web pages. --<a href="/User:Gandalf" title="User:Gandalf">Gandalf</a> 07:18, 31 May 2005 (PDT)</p>
<p>Is there a way to make forEach make use of break?</p>
<p>[1].forEach(function(value, index, array){</p>
<pre class="eval"> print(value);
 //break?
 if (value&gt;1){
   return false;//we could have some way to break when we return false
 }
</pre>
<p>}); //woulld print 1 2</p>

<p>Another option would be to throw StopIteration and catch it within forEach().</p>
