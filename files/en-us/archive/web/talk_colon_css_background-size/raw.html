<p>Should not the "Browser compatibility" table also list Google Chrome and Konqueror? Chome is not mentioned at all, but is becoming increasingly popular. Konqueror is listed <em>below</em> the table, which seems inconsistent. <a href="/User:Znerd">Znerd</a> 04 August 2009</p>
<p>Chrome, Iron, Icab4, OmniWeb etc. are based on WebKit, like Netscape 6-8, SeaMonkey, Camino, Flock, Fennec, Blackbird etc. are based on Gecko. Both layout engines are mentioned in the table. People should refer to the WebKit and Gecko version to get the info they need.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Agreed; we should definitely encourage people to look stuff up by engine rather than browser. These tables should be revised over time to list Gecko, WebKit, Internet Explorer, and Opera, with perhaps a tooltip on each that provides details on which browsers are encompassed by each. I'm going to post on dev-mdc momentarily with a proposal on this. (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/User:Sheppy">Sheppy</a> 07 December 2009)</p>
<p>We should encourage web developers to ask for layout engines, not for browsers. [That said, the popularity of Chrome let me think of a table row like    <em>Safari, Chrome (WebKit) | 4.0, 2.0 (528</em>).    But I'm not able and willing spending time for this. Remember you have to test yourself, don't trust online references, don't trust WebKit | Apple | Google homepage, they are wrong. DON'T TRUST THE INTERNET AT ALLl! ]</p>
<p>Listing Konqueror below the table is a compromise for consistency. Feel free to put it inside, nothing is set in stone.</p>
<ol> <li>Konqueror's global market share is 0.05%, (&lt; 5% of Linux users). Given the fact that this reference has serious shortcomings in many places and few contributors, I think spending much time here is not effective. People especially interested in this browser are welcome to contribute.</li> <li>It's hard to get reliable information about its CSS support without having this browser (read: multiple versions of this browser) installed. Are you able and willing to do that for all CSS properties?  If so, feel free to change the <a class="internal" href="/en/CSS_Reference/Property_Template" title="/en/CSS Reference/Property Template">en/CSS_Reference/Property_Template</a> and all CSS property pages ; )  Start with <code>-webkit-background-size </code>and investigate support of<code> contain </code>and<code> cover </code>keywords and "omitted second value" behavior. [I assume it's the same as Safari, since they just backported a WebKit patch into KHTML. But we need facts, rather than assumptions.]</li>
</ol>
<p>Btw, some time ago I'v listed Opera in the property template table and removed Netscape because Netscape is Gecko based and Opera has a global market share of &gt; 2% (&gt; 40% in some European countries).</p>

&lt;hr&gt;
<p>Is there anyway to have the -moz-border-image only apply if -moz-background-size is not supported?  I'm guessing not, just asking because having both rules in for 3.6 creates a strange effect: -moz-border-image gets inherited by every element on the page</p>
<p><a href="/profiles/robertc">User:robertc</a> 2009-08-08</p>
<p> <code>-moz-border-image </code>should not inherit. Some example code? <a href="/profiles/Jürgen Jeka">User:Jürgen Jeka</a> 2009-08-09</p>
<p>OK, <a class=" external" href="http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/css3/bg-image-1.html">here's a page with both rules</a> - the CSS is derived from the code on the page here, <a class=" external" href="http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/css3/ff/bg-image-1.png">this is what it looks like in 3.6a2pre on Linux</a>, the background image appears on the whole page, and then again behind the main content. <a class=" external" href="http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/css3/bg-image-6-moz.html">Here's a slightly more complex example</a> (<a class=" external" href="http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/css3/ff/bg-image-6-moz.png">screenshot</a>), and <a class=" external" href="http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/css3/bg-image-6.html">the same page without the -moz-border-image image rule</a> (<a class=" external" href="http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/css3/ff/bg-image-6.png">screenshot</a>). <a href="/profiles/robertc">User:robertc</a> 2009-08-09</p>
<p>This is only an issue with <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>. &lt;body&gt;'s background extends per CSS spec to &lt;html&gt;. Since you have a 8px default margin on &lt;body&gt; and your &lt;body&gt;'s content is smaller than the viewport's height, you see what you see. Styles like this should work:</p>
<pre>body { border:0; margin:0; padding:0.6em }

/* or for less content, if body is small */
html, body { height:100%; } body { border:0; margin:0; padding:0.6em }
</pre>
<p>Furthermore, you may simplify things a bit if you apply the background and border-image styles to &lt;html&gt; rather than &lt;body&gt;.</p>
<p><a href="/profiles/Jürgen Jeka">User:Jürgen Jeka</a> 2009-08-12</p>
<p>OK, probably my understanding of CSS inheritance isn't all it should be.  I tried locating the part of the spec about &lt;body&gt;'s background extending to &lt;html&gt; but it didn't seem to be explicitly mentioned in the Cascading and Inheritance section and both the background-image and border-image say 'inherited: no'.  And anyway, it's more the -moz-border-image that seems to be the problem - that gets inherited even if I add in -moz-border-image: none, to &lt;body&gt; or &lt;html&gt;, and setting the height to 100% is more a matter of covering it up rather than stopping it happening (see further examples <a class=" external" href="http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/css3/bg-image-1a.html">a</a>, <a class=" external" href="http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/css3/bg-image-1b.html">b</a> and <a class=" external" href="http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/css3/bg-image-1c.html">c</a> - b and c look OK, but adding margin or padding reveals that the image applies to both &lt;body&gt; and &lt;html&gt; even though explicitly set to none) <a href="/profiles/robertc">User:robertc</a> 2009-08-14</p>
