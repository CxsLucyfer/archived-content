<p>Gecko supports the character encodings defined in the <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/">Encoding Standard</a>.</p>

<p>In Gecko-internal APIs, it is necessary to use particular (potentially) mixed-case names for the encodings. For encodings that have a <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-document-characterset">compatibility name</a> in the DOM Standard, except gbk, this is the compatibilty name. For other encodings, including gbk, this is the lower-case name from the Encoding Standard.</p>
