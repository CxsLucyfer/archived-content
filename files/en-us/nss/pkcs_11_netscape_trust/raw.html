<p><a class="external" href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2133" title="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2133">PKCS #11</a> is a standard that defines ways to store certificates, keys and perform crypto operations. It does not specify a way to store trust objects.</p>
<p>Trust objects are used to assign an explicit level of trust to a certificate. Examples of trust assertions are certificate authority root certificates. This document outlines the way in which NSS stores trust objects via PKCS#11. This is not a new design, but documentation of the method already in use.</p>
<h2 id="Trust_Objects">Trust Objects</h2>
<p>A trust object describes a level of trust in a certificate for a given usage or purpose. Conceptually a trust object contains the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Certificate Reference</li>
 <li>Purpose + Level of trust (multiple)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Purpose_Level_of_Trust">Purpose + Level of Trust</h3>
<p>A trust object ultimately denotes a level of trust in a certificate. The trust is expressed for a specific purpose (or usage). A trust object contains multiple purposes and the level of trust for each one. Examples of purposes are: email, code signing, authenticating a server.</p>
<p>The levels of trust are:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Untrusted: The certificate is explicitly untrusted.</li>
 <li>Unknown: The trust is not known and should be determined elsewhere.</li>
 <li>Trusted: The certificate itself is explicitly trusted.</li>
 <li>Trusted Delegator: The certificate is trusted as a certificate authority trust root, and confers its trust to other certificates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Certificate_Reference">Certificate Reference</h3>
<p>Each trust object contains a reference to a certificate.<br>
 <br>
 There are two ways to refer to a certificate depending on whether that certificate is self-signed (like a certificate authority) or signed by another trusted certificate.</p>
<p>Certificates used as a root of trust are referred to by the complete hash of the DER value of the certificate. Certificates in a trust chain whose issuer is trusted are referred to by the DER value of the issuer field, and the serial number.</p>
<h2 id="PKCS11_Representation">PKCS#11 Representation</h2>
<p>Trust objects are stored as objects on a PKCS#11 token.  Although these are specific to a certificate, they do not need to be stored on the same token as the certificate.  Trust objects are of the class CKO_NETSCAPE_TRUST and have the following attributes.</p>
