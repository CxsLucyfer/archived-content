<p>Once upon a time interfaces were "frozen" (promised to never change until the major version number changes) for the use of embedders and other users.  Interfaces that were "under review" were candidates to be frozen.  As of Mozilla 2.0 all interfaces have been unfrozen and will not be frozen in the future, so the class of "under review" interfaces no longer exists.</p>
