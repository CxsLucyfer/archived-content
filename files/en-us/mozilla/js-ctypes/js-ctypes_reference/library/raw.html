These libraries are what enable js-ctypes to work. The alternative to standard libraries is creating your own DLL (for Windows) or SO (for Linux) file with C functions that can be called from your add-on with js-ctypes. The DLL/SO/etc file you make must be shipped with your add-on. Standard libraries offer the advantage of not having to ship anything. They are already available on the operating system for you. You just need to supply the path to appropriate files and set up the proper types of values/arguments in the js-ctypes code.

<h2 id="Alternative_Syntax">Alternative Syntax</h2>

<p>Another use for ctypes.declare is to get non-function/non-methods from libraries. The syntax for this is seen in Firefox codebase here:</p>

<p><a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/ctypes/Library.cpp?offset=0#271">https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/ctypes/Library.cpp?offset=0#271</a></p>

<p>This shows that we can also supply only two arguments to the declare function. The first being the same as in the above example, name, which is the name of the symbol to export. And in place of the abi argument, we will pass in the type of this export. For example, from the Objective-C library we can export the symbol which holds the address to an external block. This would be done like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var objc = ctypes.open(ctypes.<span class="pl-c1">libraryName</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>objc<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>));

objc.<span class="pl-c1">declare</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>_NSConcreteGlobalBlock<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>, ctypes.<span class="pl-c1">voidptr_t</span>);</pre>
