<h2 id="ctypes_Reference">ctypes Reference</h2>

<p>The <code>ctypes</code> object is the base of the ctypes API. It is obtained by by loading the ctypes module:</p>

<p><code>Components.utils.import("<a class="external" rel="freelink">resource://gre/modules/ctypes.jsm</a>");</code></p>

<p>You can use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes" title="The ctypes object contains methods and predefined data types used to create and manage a library."><code>ctypes</code></a> object to load libraries, construct types, and perform miscellaneous tasks such as type casting. The <code><code>ctypes</code></code> object also provides numerous <a href="/en/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes#Predefined_data_types" title="en/js-ctypes/js-ctypes reference/ctypes#Predefined data types">predefined types</a> that correspond to primitives and common typedefs in C.</p>

<h2 id="Working_with_libraries">Working with libraries</h2>

<p>To load a <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/Library" title="The Library object represents a native library loaded by the ctypes open() method. Its methods let you declare symbols exported by the library, and to manage the library."><code>Library</code></a>, use <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes#open()" title="The ctypes object contains methods and predefined data types used to create and manage a library."><code>ctypes.open()</code></a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/Library" title="The Library object represents a native library loaded by the ctypes open() method. Its methods let you declare symbols exported by the library, and to manage the library."><code>Library</code></a> object is used mostly to declare native functions provided by the library so that js-ctypes knows how to call them. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/Library#declare()" title="The Library object represents a native library loaded by the ctypes open() method. Its methods let you declare symbols exported by the library, and to manage the library."><code>Library.declare()</code></a> for instructions on how to declare these functions.</p>

<p>Once you have finished working with a Library, call <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/Library#close()" title="The Library object represents a native library loaded by the ctypes open() method. Its methods let you declare symbols exported by the library, and to manage the library."><code>Library.close()</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="Calling_conventions">Calling conventions</h2>

<p>See <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ABI" title="This article describes the calling conventions with respect to js-ctypes while programming x86 and x86-64/x64/AMD64 architectures. A calling convention is an implementation-level (low-level) scheme regarding how subroutines receive parameters from their caller and how they revert."><code>ABI</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="Types_and_data">Types and data</h2>

<p>To use js-ctypes effectively, it is important to understand the different kinds of objects that the module provides. There are three major categories:</p>

<h3 id="Types">Types</h3>

<p>These represent a type in C, and are thus represented by <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/CType" title="All data types declared using the js-ctypes API are represented by CType objects. These objects have assorted methods and properties that let you create objects of these types, find out information about them, and so forth. The specific properties and methods on each object vary depending on the data type represented."><code>CType</code></a> objects. These objects have two main purposes. First, they provide a concrete representation of different data types, allowing the programmer to describe the arguments and return type of a native function (see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/Library#declare()" title="The Library object represents a native library loaded by the ctypes open() method. Its methods let you declare symbols exported by the library, and to manage the library."><code>Library.declare()</code></a>).  Second, they serve as constructors to create concrete instances of the given type, i.e. <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/CData" title="A CData object represents a C value or function located in memory."><code>CData</code></a> objects.</p>

<p>Out of the box, js-ctypes supports a number of <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes#Predefined_data_types" title="The ctypes object contains methods and predefined data types used to create and manage a library.">predefined types</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Type_constructors">Type constructors</h3>

<p>These are functions that define new types, and thus return a <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/CType" title="All data types declared using the js-ctypes API are represented by CType objects. These objects have assorted methods and properties that let you create objects of these types, find out information about them, and so forth. The specific properties and methods on each object vary depending on the data type represented."><code>CType</code></a> object. These include</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/PointerType" title="Returns a new CType object describing a new pointer data type."><code>ctypes.PointerType(type)</code></a> and the <code>.ptr</code> property, which creates a new type describing a pointer to an existing type.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ArrayType" title="ArrayType represents C arrays"><code>ctypes.ArrayType(type, [length])</code></a> and the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/CType#array()" title="All data types declared using the js-ctypes API are represented by CType objects. These objects have assorted methods and properties that let you create objects of these types, find out information about them, and so forth. The specific properties and methods on each object vary depending on the data type represented."><code>.array()</code></a> method, which creates a new type describing an array of objects of an existing type.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/StructType" title="Returns a CType object describing a new structure data type. This data type provides the ability to define and manipulate values of the C struct type."><code>ctypes.StructType()</code></a>, which creates a new type describing a C struct.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/FunctionType" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>ctypes.FunctionType(abi, returnType, argType1 [, argType2 ...])</code></a>, which creates a new type describing a C function.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Data">Data</h3>

<p>These are instances of types, represented by <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/CData" title="A CData object represents a C value or function located in memory."><code>CData</code></a> objects and instantiated by calling <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/CType" title="All data types declared using the js-ctypes API are represented by CType objects. These objects have assorted methods and properties that let you create objects of these types, find out information about them, and so forth. The specific properties and methods on each object vary depending on the data type represented."><code>CType</code></a> objects as functions.<span id="1314129036225E" style="display: none;"> </span></p>

<p>These distinctions are crucial, and understanding them will alleviate much of the confusion surrounding js-ctypes. Calling a Type Constructor will return a <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/CType" title="All data types declared using the js-ctypes API are represented by CType objects. These objects have assorted methods and properties that let you create objects of these types, find out information about them, and so forth.

Calling a <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/CType" title="All data types declared using the js-ctypes API are represented by CType objects. These objects have assorted methods and properties that let you create objects of these types, find out information about them, and so forth.

You <em>call</em> a native function with <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/CData" title="A CData object represents a C value or function located in memory."><code>CData</code></a> objects.</p>

<h2 id="Other_Features">Other Features</h2>

<h3 id="Error-handling">Error-handling</h3>

<p>js-ctypes supports both <a href="/en/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes#Properties" title="en/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes#Properties">errno</a> (on all platforms) and <a href="/en/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes#Properties" title="en/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes#Properties">GetLastError</a> (on Windows platforms).</p>

<h3 id="Callbacks">Callbacks</h3>

<p>You can pass regular JavaScript functions as callbacks to native functions. See the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/Using_js-ctypes/Declaring_and_Using_Callbacks" title="en/js-ctypes/js-ctypes reference/Callbacks">Callbacks</a> page for details.</p>

<h3 id="64-Bit_integer_handling">64-Bit integer handling</h3>

<p>Because JavaScript <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number" title="The Number JavaScript object is a wrapper object allowing you to work with numerical values. A Number object is created using the Number() constructor. A primitive type object number created using the Number() function."><code>Number</code></a> objects can't directly represent every possible 64-bit integer value, js-ctypes provides new types for these. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/Int64" title="Because JavaScript doesn't currently include standard support for 64-bit integer values, js-ctypes offers the Int64 and UInt64 objects to let you work with C functions and data that need (or may need) values represented using a 64-bit data type."><code>Int64</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/UInt64" title="As JavaScript doesn't currently include standard support for 64-bit integer values, js-ctypes offers the Int64 and UInt64 objects to let you work with C functions and data that need (or may need) to use data represented using a 64-bit data type."><code>UInt64</code></a>.</p>
