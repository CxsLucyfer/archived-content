The DLL/SO/etc file you make must be shipped with your add-on. Standard libraries offer the advantage of not having to ship anything. They are already available on the operating system for you.

<p>At the heart of js-ctypes is the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes#open%28%29">ctypes.open()</a></code> function. This must be called before any work can commence. There are two options:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Custom Native File (DLL, SO, DYLIB, etc.)</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/Using_js-ctypes/Standard_OS_Libraries">Standard OS Libraries</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Custom_native_file">Custom native file</h3>

<p>For this method, a native file must be created. A native file for use on UNIX systems is an SO file, which is created and a C function called <code>add()</code> is written.</p>

<pre>int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
</pre>

<p>To make this a shared library, a native file which can be loaded and used from js-ctypes, compile it with these commands:</p>

<pre>gcc -fPIC -c myCFuntionsForUnix.c
gcc -shared -o myCFuntionsForUnix.so myCFuntionsForUnix.o
</pre>

<p>A file named <code>myCFuntionsForUnix.so</code> is successfully created. This native file can be placed in any folder of an addon and then loaded from js-ctypes. They can also be loaded from the system library path.</p>

<h4 id="Loading_the_native_file">Loading the native file</h4>

<p>If your addon is restartless, you must set it to be unpacked. See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19382201/how-to-load-dll-from-sdk-addon-data-folder</p>

<p>It is important to note that custom native files cannot be loaded through <code>chrome://</code> or <code>resource://</code> URIs. They must be accessed through a local file path  (<code>file://</code>) or a JAR path (<code>jar:</code>). If the addon is an unpacked addon, such as bootstrap or <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/SDK">Add-on SDK</a> addons, the JAR path must be used. Therefore, the path has to be converted and then the converted path is used for loading with <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/js-ctypes_reference/ctypes#open%28%29">ctypes.open</a></code>.</p>

<p>If the native file is located at <code>chrome://youraddon/content/mySubFolder/myCFunctionsForUnix.so</code> then it is converted to a File URI like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/Services.jsm");
var cr = Components.classes['@mozilla.org/chrome/chrome-registry;1'].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIChromeRegistry);

var chromeURI_myLib = Services.io.newURI('chrome://youraddon/content/mySubFolder/myCFunctionsForUnix.so', 'UTF-8', null);
var localFile_myLib = cr.convertChromeURL(chromeURI_myLib);
var jarPath_myLib = localFile_myLib.spec; // "jar:file:///C:/Users/Vayeate/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/aecgxse.Unnamed%20Profile%201/extensions/youraddon@jetpack.xpi!/mySubFolder/myCFunctionsForUnix.so"
var filePath_myLib = localFilemyLib.path; // "file:///C:/Users/Vayeate/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/aecgxse.Unnamed%20Profile%201/extensions/youraddon@jetpack.xpi!/mySubFolder/myCFunctionsForUnix.so"</pre>

<div class="note">
<p>If your add-on is a bootstrap add-on, then you don't need to use this method to convert a chrome:// path; instead, on startup procedure of the bootstrap add-on obtain the File and/or JAR path from installPath from the aData parameter.</p>

<pre>function startup(aData, aReason) {
    var nsIFile_folder = aData.installPath; // if addon is unpacked, this will be the addon folder. if addon is packed, this will be addon xpi
}</pre>

<p>This can then be joined with your file name to obtain it's path like this:</p>

<pre>function startup(aData, aReason) {

    var jarPath_folder = 'jar:' + OS.Path.toFileURI(aData.installPath.path) + '!/'; // if unpacked is false in install.rdf this will look like: "jar:file:///C:/Users/Vayeate/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/aksozfjt.Unnamed%20Profile%2010/extensions/AsyncZip@jetpack!/"
    var filePath_folder = aData.installPath.path; // if unpacked is set to false in install.rdf this will look like: "C:\Users\Vayeate\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\aksozfjt.Unnamed Profile 10\extensions\AsyncZip@jetpack"

    var filePath_myLib = OS.Path.join(filePath_folder, 'mySubFolder', 'myCFunctionsForUnix.so');
    var jarPath_myLib = jarPath_folder + 'mySubFolder/myCFunctionsForUnix.so';
}</pre>
</div>

<p>This can then be opened and the C functions within can be used from js-ctypes.</p>

<pre>var lib = ctypes.open(filePath_myLib);

var add_with_c = lib.declare("add", ctypes.default_abi,
    ctypes.int,    // return type
    ctypes.int,    // a
    ctypes.int     // b
);

var rez = add_with_c(2, 5); // rez is 7

lib.close();
</pre>
