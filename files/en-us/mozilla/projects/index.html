<p><span class="seoSummary">Mozilla has a number of projects other than <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox">Firefox</a> itself. Many of these are components of Firefox or are tools used to create Firefox, but may be used by other projects as well. Here you'll find links to documentation about these projects.</span></p>

 <strong>McCoy</strong> is an application that allows add-on authors to provide secure updates to their users. Applications periodically look for and install updates to their add-ons. It's important that the update information retrieved has not been tampered with since being written by the add-on author. Specifically, it focuses on the process of digitally signing update manifests so the applications can verify the integrity of a manifest retrieved over normally insecure channels.</dd><dt class="landingPageList"><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Midas">Midas</a></dt><dd class="landingPageList">Midas is the code name for Gecko's built-in rich text editor.

 The language is written in JSON, but we do not expect people to write Zest in this format - it is designed to be a visual language. The core language does not define any graphical representation - that is expected to be defined by the tools that integrate Zest.<br>
 It is completely free, open source and can be included in any tool whether open or closed, free or commercial.<br>
 <br>
 Zest is still at a very early stage of development, but is has been made available so that anyone can play around with it.<br>
 All constructive feedback is very welcome.<br>
 Anyone can contribute to the onward development of Zest, and teams or individuals who develop security tools are especially welcome to join and help shape Zest's future.</dd></dl></div>
