<p>There are two types of history asset lists, one used for adding/modiyfing/verifying history, and the other for deleting history.</p>
<p>The history list used for operations other than delete has the following properties:</p>
<ul> <li><strong>uri</strong>: required.</li> <li><strong>title</strong>: optional. The page title for this uri.</li> <li><strong>visits</strong>: required. An array of objects representing visits to the page, each object has the following properties: <ul> <li><strong>type</strong>: required. An integer value from one of the transition types listed at <a class="external free" href="../../../../en/nsINavHistoryService#Constants" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/nsINavHistoryService#Constants</a>.</li> <li><strong>date</strong>: required. An integer representing when the visit took place, expressed in hours from the present. For example, 0 is now, -24 is 24 hours in the past.</li> </ul> </li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">var history_initial = [
  { uri: "http://www.google.com/",
    title: "Google",
    visits: [
      { type: 1, date: 0 },
      { type: 2, date: -1 }
    ]
  },
  { uri: "http://www.cnn.com/",
    title: "CNN",
    visits: [
      { type: 1, date: -1 },
      { type: 2, date: -36 }
    ]
  },
];
</pre>
<p>The history list used for deletions looks different. It's an array of objects, each of which represents a type of history to delete. There are three different types:</p>
<ul> <li>to delete all references to a specific page from history, use an object with a <strong>uri</strong> property</li> <li>to delete all references to all pages from a specific host, use an object with a <strong>host</strong> property</li> <li>to delete all history in a certain time period, use an object with <strong>begin</strong> and <strong>end</strong> properties, which should have integer values that express time since the present in hours (see <strong>date</strong> above)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">var history_to_delete = [
  { uri: "http://www.cnn.com/" },
  { begin: -24,
    end: -1 },
  { host: "www.google.com" }
];
</pre>

<p>History lists cannot be modified, they can only be added, deleted, and verified, using the following functions:</p>
<ul> <li>History.add</li> <li>History.delete</li> <li>History.verify</li> <li>History.verifyNot</li>
</ul>
