<h2 id="Introduction"> Introduction </h2>
<p>Previously, all I/O in the NetScape Portable Runtime (NSPR) was <em>blocking</em> (or <em>synchronous</em>). A thread invoking an io function is blocked until the io operation is finished. The blocking io model encourages the use of multiple threads as a programming model. A thread is typically created to attend to one of the simultaneous I/O operations that may potentially block.
</p><p>In the <em>nonblocking</em> io model, a file descriptor may be marked as nonblocking. An io function on a nonblocking file descriptor either succeeds immediately or fails immediately with &lt;tt&gt;PR_WOULD_BLOCK_ERROR&lt;/tt&gt;. A single thread is sufficient to attend to multiple nonblocking file descriptors simultaneously. Typically, this central thread invokes &lt;tt&gt;PR_Poll()&lt;/tt&gt; on a set of nonblocking file descriptors. (Note: &lt;tt&gt;PR_Poll()&lt;/tt&gt; also works with blocking file descriptors, although it is less useful in the blocking io model.) When &lt;tt&gt;PR_Poll()&lt;/tt&gt; reports that a file descriptor is ready for some io operation, the central thread invokes that io function on the file descriptor.

<h2 id="Creating_a_Nonblocking_Socket"> Creating a Nonblocking Socket </h2>
<p><em>Only sockets can be made nonblocking</em>. Regular files always operate in blocking mode. This is not a serious constraint as one can assume that disk I/O never blocks. Fundamentally, this constraint is due to the fact that nonblocking I/O and &lt;tt&gt;select()&lt;/tt&gt; are only available to sockets on some platforms (e.g., Winsock).
</p><p>In NSPR, a new socket returned by &lt;tt&gt;PR_NewTCPSocket()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;PR_NewUDPSocket()&lt;/tt&gt; is always created in blocking mode. One can make the new socket nonblocking by using &lt;tt&gt;PR_SetSockOpt()&lt;/tt&gt; as in the example below (error checking is omitted for clarity):
</p><p><br>&lt;tt&gt;PRFileDesc *sock;&lt;/tt&gt;
<br><b>&lt;tt&gt;PRIntn optval = 1;&lt;/tt&gt;</b>
</p>
<p>&lt;tt&gt;sock = PR_NewTCPSocket();&lt;/tt&gt; </p><pre>/*
* Make the socket nonblocking
*/

PR_SetSockOpt(sock, PR_SockOpt_Nonblocking, &amp;optval, sizeof(optval));
</pre>
<h2 id="Programming_Constraints"> Programming Constraints </h2>
<p>There are some constraints due to the use of NT asynchronous I/O in the NSPR. In NSPR, blocking sockets on NT are associated with an I/O completion port. Once associated with an I/O completion port, we can't disassociate the socket from the I/O completion port. I have seen some strange problems with using a nonblocking socket associated with an I/O completion port. So the first constraint is:
</p>
<blockquote><strong>The blocking/nonblocking io mode of a new socket is committed the first time a <em>potentially-blocking io function</em> is invoked on the socket. Once the io mode of a socket is committed, it cannot be changed.</strong></blockquote>
<p>The potentially-blocking io functions include &lt;tt&gt;PR_Connect()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_Accept()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_AcceptRead()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_Read()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_Write()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_Writev()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_Recv()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_Send()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_RecvFrom()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_SendTo()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;PR_TransmitFile(),&lt;/tt&gt; and do not include &lt;tt&gt;PR_Bind()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;PR_Listen()&lt;/tt&gt;.
</p><p>In blocking mode, any of these potentially-blocking functions requires the use of the NT I/O completion port. So at that point we must determine whether to associate the socket with the I/O completion or not, and that decision cannot be changed later.
</p><p>There is a second constraint, due to the use of NT asynchronous I/O and the recycling of used sockets:
</p>
<blockquote><strong>The new socket returned by &lt;tt&gt;PR_Accept()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;PR_AcceptRead()&lt;/tt&gt; inherits the blocking/nonblocking io mode of the listening socket and this cannot be changed.</strong></blockquote>
<p>The socket returned by &lt;tt&gt;PR_Accept()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;PR_AcceptRead()&lt;/tt&gt; on a blocking, listening socket may be a recycled socket previously used in a &lt;tt&gt;PR_TransmitFile()&lt;/tt&gt; call. Since &lt;tt&gt;PR_TransmitFile()&lt;/tt&gt; only operates in blocking mode, this recycled socket can only be reused in blocking mode, hence the above constraint.
</p><p>Because these constraints only apply to NT, it is advised that you test your cross-platform code that uses nonblocking io on NT early in the development cycle. These constraints are enforced in the debug NSPR library by assertions.
</p>
<h2 id="Differences_from_Blocking_IO"> Differences from Blocking IO </h2>
<ul><li> In nonblocking mode, the timeout argument for the io functions is ignored.
</li><li> &lt;tt&gt;PR_AcceptRead()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;PR_TransmitFile()&lt;/tt&gt; only work on blocking sockets. They do not make sense in nonblocking mode.
</li><li> &lt;tt&gt;PR_Write()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_Send()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_Writev()&lt;/tt&gt; in blocking mode block until the entire buffer is sent. In nonblocking mode, they cannot block, so they may return with just sending part of the buffer.
</li></ul>
<h2 id="PR_Poll()_or_PR_Select()"> PR_Poll() or PR_Select()? </h2>
<p>&lt;tt&gt;PR_Select()&lt;/tt&gt; is deprecated, now declared in &lt;tt&gt;private/pprio.h&lt;/tt&gt;. Use &lt;tt&gt;PR_Poll()&lt;/tt&gt; instead.
</p><p>The current implementation of &lt;tt&gt;PR_Select()&lt;/tt&gt; simply calls &lt;tt&gt;PR_Poll()&lt;/tt&gt;, so it is sure to have worse performance. Also, native file descriptors (socket handles) cannot be added to &lt;tt&gt;PR_fd_set&lt;/tt&gt;, i.e., the functions &lt;tt&gt;PR_FD_NSET&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_FD_NCLR&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PR_FD_NISSET&lt;/tt&gt; do not work.
</p>
<h2 id="PR_Available()"> PR_Available() </h2>
<p>When &lt;tt&gt;PR_Available()&lt;/tt&gt; returns 0, it may mean one of two things:
</p>
<ul><li> There is no data available for reading on that socket. I.e., &lt;tt&gt;PR_Recv()&lt;/tt&gt; would block (a blocking socket) or fail with &lt;tt&gt;PR_WOULD_BLOCK_ERROR&lt;/tt&gt; (a nonblocking socket).
</li><li> The TCP connection on that socket has been closed (end of stream).
</li></ul>
<p>These two cases can be distinguished by &lt;tt&gt;PR_Poll()&lt;/tt&gt;. If &lt;tt&gt;PR_Poll()&lt;/tt&gt; reports that the socket is readable (i.e., &lt;tt&gt;PR_POLL_READ&lt;/tt&gt; is set in &lt;tt&gt;out_flags&lt;/tt&gt;), and &lt;tt&gt;PR_Available()&lt;/tt&gt; returns 0, this means that the socket connection is closed.
