<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Zest</strong> is an experimental specialized scripting language (also known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language</a>) developed by the Mozilla security team and is intended to be used in web oriented security tools.<br>
 The language is written in JSON, but we do not expect people to write Zest in this format - it is designed to be a visual language. The core language does not define any graphical representation - that is expected to be defined by the tools that integrate Zest.<br>
 It is completely free, open source and can be included in any tool whether open or closed, free or commercial.<br>
 <br>
 Zest is still at a very early stage of development, but is has been made available so that anyone can play around with it.<br>
 All constructive feedback is very welcome.<br>
 Anyone can contribute to the onward development of Zest, and teams or individuals who develop security tools are especially welcome to join and help shape Zest's future.</p>
