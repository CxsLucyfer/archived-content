<p><code>compare-locales</code> is a Python script that helps localizers to check their work without running Firefox or another application.</p>

<p>If you want to run <code>compare-locales</code> on Windows, be sure to first install <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaBuild" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions/Windows_Prerequisites#MozillaBuild_.2F_Pymake">MozillaBuild</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Installation">Installation</h3>

<p><code>compare-locales</code> needs to be installed, and it requires that you have Python 2.7 or 3.5+ installed on your machine. The easiest way is to just run</p>

<pre>$ pip install -U compare-locales
</pre>

<h3 id="Running_it">Running it</h3>

<p><code>compare-locales</code> gathers the directories to compare from a TOML file, usually found in <code>$APP/locales/l10n.toml</code>. The details of the configuration file are described in the <a href="https://moz-l10n-config.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fileformat.html">l10n-config docs</a>. You pass the path to the toml file and the parent dir of the localizations as first arguments, followed by the locale codes of the locales you want to compare. If you want to test the localization for <code>de</code>, run</p>

<pre>$ compare-locales browser/locales/l10n.toml ./l10n/ de
</pre>

<p>To check <strong>mobile</strong>, replace the previous line with:</p>

<pre>$ compare-locales mobile/android/locales/l10n.toml ./l10n/ zh-TW
</pre>

<p>To check <strong>mail</strong>, <strong>suite</strong>, <strong>calendar </strong>that lives on comm-central,Â  you can either rely on the check-out of mozilla within comm-central repository that the regular comm-central build instructions generate:</p>

<pre>$ compare-locales ./comm-central/mail/locales/l10n.toml ./l10n/ zh-TW
</pre>

<p>If you don't want to use a copy of mozilla-central in comm-central, you can run them separately:</p>

<pre>$ compare-locales -Dmozilla=$PWD/mozilla-central comm-central/mail/locales/l10n.toml ./l10n/ zh-TW
</pre>

<p>If you're working on multiple projects in parallel, you can also pass all the toml files to compare-locales at once. To get a single result across the projects, specify the <code>--unified</code> flag:</p>

<pre>$ compare-locales --unified browser/locales/l10n.toml mobile/android/locales/l10n.toml ./l10n/ de</pre>

<h4 id="Cross-channel_and_compare-locales">Cross-channel and compare-locales</h4>

<p>If you're working against the gecko-strings cross-channel repository, the toml configuration files are in the <code>_configs</code> subdirectory, <code>browser.toml</code>, <code>mobile_android.toml</code>, <code>mail.toml</code> and <code>calendar.toml</code>, and suite.toml.</p>

<h4 id="Options">Options</h4>

<p>To get a brief list of available options, use the <code>--help</code> flag:</p>

<pre>$ compare-locales --help
</pre>

<h3 id="The_output">The output</h3>

<p>The output of <code>compare-locales</code> shows the missing and obsolete strings in a pseudo-diff format.</p>

<pre>ab-CD
  browser
    chrome/browser
      browser.dtd
          +backForwardMenu.tooltip
          +fullZoomEnlargeCmd.commandkey3
          +fullZoomReduceCmd.commandkey2
          +fullZoomResetCmd.commandkey2
          +organizeBookmarks.label
          -showAllBookmarksCmd2.label
      migration/migration.dtd
          -importFromFile.accesskey
          -importFromFile.label
          +importFromHTMLFile.accesskey
          +importFromHTMLFile.label
</pre>

<p>You can assume changed strings when you see entities removed and added with a similar name. The file names will be shown in a hierarchical form, so in the example above, your files are browser.dtd in ab-CD/browser/chrome/browser and migration.dtd in another directory level deeper.</p>

<p>The output closes with a summary, giving the total counts of missing and obsolete strings and words, and some statistics on how many strings are changed or not, excluding access- and commandkeys. That gives localizers an idea on how thorough the localization is. This number won't reach 100% in general, mid 80s should be the target, though.</p>

<p>Pass --json to get just the summary in JSON format.</p>
