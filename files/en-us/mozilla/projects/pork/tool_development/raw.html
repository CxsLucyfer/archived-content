<p>Most tools are in the "oink" directory. The "renamer" tool is used as an example; tests are in the "oink/renamer_tests" subdirectory.</p>

<h3 id="Replacement">Replacement</h3>

<p>For the "renamer" tool, a diff file is generated as the AST is traversed, using the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor pattern</a>. The diff file is generated using the "Patcher" class.</p>

<p><strong>source locations</strong> AST nodes have a location associated with them; SourceLoc is defined to be an integer corresponding to an string offset. This can be translated to an UnboxedLoc, which has a line and column offset (see renamer.cc:65).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>macro expansion</strong> This section refers to macro expansion when using mcpp (see <a class="internal" href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Pork/Installing" title="En/Installing Pork">Installing Pork</a>). For the rename_class.cpp test, generate the file with "<span style="font-family: Courier New;">gcc -E -Wp,-W0,-K rename_class.cpp &gt; rename_class.cc</span>" and run the renamer with "<span style="font-family: Courier New;">../renamer -rename Foo Bar rename_class.cc</span>".</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">For terminology, suppose "MY_FOO" --&gt; "Foo". Then any post-location variables refer to "Foo" and pre-location variables refer to "MY_FOO". CPPSourceLoc wraps SourceLoc, providing information about macro expansion. CPPSourceLoc will change the previously provided location information (in variable cpp_source_loc._loc) from post-location to pre-location. All values from the AST refer to the post-location.</p>
