 <dd>A common bug to diagnose with Emscripten is where a big game fails due to an out of memory error (OOM) somewhere during load time. By the time <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/about:memory">about:memory</a> is loaded in a new tab and you have clicked the "Measure" button to diagnose what's happened, the memory usage causing the spike has gone away, making temporary memory spikes difficult to diagnose. This article explains how to debug such problems.</dd>
