<div class="note">
<p>Since Firefox/Gecko 13 jsdouble has been removed, and instead it is possible to use the default C/C++ type <code><strong>double</strong></code>. You should be able to just replace every usage of jsdouble with double in your code.</p>
</div>

<p><strong><code>jsdouble</code></strong> is a C floating-point number type. It is defined to be a 64-bit, IEEE 754 compliant type. See <a class="external" href="http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-8.5">ECMA 262-3 ยง8.5</a>. Arithmetic on <code>jsdouble</code> values in C should behave exactly like the floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript, except that C and JavaScript may treat not-a-number values differently.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation note:</strong> SpiderMonkey has had several bugs involving details of floating-point arithmetic on various platforms. Controlling the behavior of floating-point arithmetic is very architecture- and system-specific, and can be hard to get right. Help in the form of test cases, commentary, and patches is always appreciated.</p>
