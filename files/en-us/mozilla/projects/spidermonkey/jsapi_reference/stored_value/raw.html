<p>In the <a href="/en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference" title="en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference">JSAPI</a>, the <strong>stored value</strong> of an object property is its last known value. For a data property, this is exactly the same thing as the property's current value.</p>
<p>The JavaScript engine sets aside a field of type <code><a href="/En/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/Jsval" title="En/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/Jsval">jsval</a></code> for the stored value of most object properties, even properties that have getters. The stored value is updated each time the program gets or sets the property. The new stored value is the result of getting or setting the property, after the getter or setter, if any, is called.</p>
<p><code><a href="/en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/JS_DefineProperty" title="en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/JS_DefineProperty">JS_DefineProperty</a></code> allows the application to specify a property's initial stored value.</p>
<p><code><a href="/en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/JS_LookupProperty" title="en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/JS_LookupProperty">JS_LookupProperty</a></code> fetches a property's stored value without triggering its getter.</p>
<p>Properties with the <code><a href="/en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/JS_GetPropertyAttributes" title="en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/JS_GetPropertyAttributes">JSPROP_SHARED</a></code> attribute do not have a stored value. ES5 accessor properties, as in <code>{get length() {Â return 0; }</code>, automatically have <code>JSPROP_SHARED</code>.</p>
<p>Properties of objects that have custom <code><a href="/en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/JSObjectOps" title="en/SpiderMonkey/JSAPI_Reference/JSObjectOps">JSObjectOps</a></code> do not have a stored value.</p>
<p>Stored values are strong references for the purpose of garbage collection. As long as an object is reachable, the stored values of its properties are reachable and will not be collected.</p>
