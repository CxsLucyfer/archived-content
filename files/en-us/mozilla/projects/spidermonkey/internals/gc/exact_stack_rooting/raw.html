<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide explains the basics of interacting with the <a href="#defineGC" title="#defineGC">GC</a> from SpiderMonkey. Since the GC may move GCThings, it very important that SpiderMonkey know about each and every <a href="#defineGCPointer" title="#defineGCPointer">GCPointer</a> in the system. The method you should use to keep the GC up-to-date with this information will vary depending on where the GCPointer is being stored. GCPointers can be stored as a property of a <a href="#defineGCThing" title="#defineGCThing">GCThing</a>, on the <a href="#defineCHeap" title="#defineCHeap">CHeap</a>, or in the <a href="#defineCStack" title="#defineCStack">CStack</a>. These three storage regions have different lifetime and overhead characteristics and thus require different management strategies for efficient space and CPU utilization. Since C++ does not reliably distinguish between storage classes, we have to put this burden on the user.</p>

<h2 id="Storing_a_GCPointer_in_a_GCThing">Storing a GCPointer in a GCThing</h2>

<p>Storing your GCPointer inside of a GCThing that is already in the <a href="#defineLiveSet" title="#defineLiveSet">LiveSet</a> is the easiest way to keep a GCThing to the LiveSet.  GCPointers that reside in GCThings fall into one of these cases: storage in a normal property, storage in a reserved slot, or storage with JS_{Get|Set}Private. Do not use JS_SetPrivate. If you see a GCPointer stored as a private, please file a bug. The private field is frequently used to store things that are not GCPointers, so the GC cannot automatically handle this slot. This means it must be manually traced by the object's owner: this is both fragile and more expensive than using an extra reserved slot, or even just putting a new property on the object.</p>

<pre>Class FooClass = {
    "FooPrototype",          /* name */
    <s>JSCLASS_HAS_PRIVATE |</s> JSCLASS_HAS_RESERVED_SLOTS(1), /* flags */
    JS_PropertyStub,         /* addProperty */
    JS_PropertyStub,         /* delProperty */
    ... etc ...
};
RootedObject obj(cx, NewObject(cx, &amp;FooClass, NullPtr(), NullPtr(), &amp;obj));
RootedValue v(cx, OBJECT_TO_VALUE(otherGCThing));
JSObject::SetReservedSlot(obj, 0, v);
</pre>

<p>TODO: Tracing and HeapPtr</p>

<h2 id="Storing_a_GCPointer_on_the_CStack">Storing a GCPointer on the CStack</h2>

<p>GCPointers stored on the CStack are special. Unlike other GCPointers, they are not traced as part of the GC. Instead, every pointer on the CStack should be considered part of the <a href="#defineRootSet" title="#defineRootSet">RootSet</a>. To that end, we have a special "Rooting" mechanism for stack pointers that is very efficiently able to add and remove GCPointers to the RootedSet. The downside of this efficiency is that GCPointers <em>must</em> be added to and removed from this RootedSet tracking structure in LIFO order. For this reason it is highly recommended that this rooting mechanism only be used on the CStack.</p>

<h3 id="jsRooted&lt;T>">js::Rooted&lt;T&gt;</h3>

<pre><strong>typedef js::Rooted&lt;T&gt; RootedT;</strong> -&gt; RootedObject, RootedString, RootedScript, etc.
</pre>

<p>Because of the LIFO restriction, using this interface manually is extremely cumbersome. Instead, SpiderMonkey has a convenient suite of C++ RAII classes to do this for you, called <code>js::RootedT</code>:</p>

<pre><code>RootedString str1(cx, JS_ValueToString(cx, val));</code>
<code>RootedString str2(rt, JS_ValueToString(cx, val));</code><code>
</code></pre>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> C++ insists that an initializing assignment (e.g., the default constructor followed by operator=) must have a copy constructor available, even if it is not used. Since it is never correct to implicitly copy a <code>js::RootedT</code> (more on this in a second) we have deleted the copy constructor from these classes. Therefore, we are forced to force you to initialize with constructor syntax.  Sorry.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: In C++, destructors are required to run in declaration order, nicely maintaining our LIFO property. However, this does not hold true for temporaries: they are undeclared, after all. Some compilers maintain LIFO order, some do not. Incorrect use of <code>js::RootedT</code> as a temporary will crash at run time.</p>
</div>

<p>There is also a static constructor method <code>fromMarkedLocation()</code> that creates a <code>Handle</code> from an arbitrary location. This is used to make Handles for things like scope chain objects, which aren't explicitly rooted themselves, but are always reachable from the implicit stack roots. Every use of these should be commented to explain why they are guaranteed to be rooted.</p>

<h3 id="jsHandle&lt;T>">js::Handle&lt;T&gt;</h3>

<pre><strong>typedef JS::Handle&lt;T&gt; js::HandleT;</strong> -&gt; HandleObject, HandleString, HandleScript, etc.
</pre>

<p>Any single GCThing is likely to get passed through a fairly deep call-stack before getting used. Even though creating a new <code>js::RootedT</code> is cheap, it is silly to repeat this work for every new call frame. To solve this, we use the standard "handle" approach. A <code>js::HandleT</code> is a pointer to a <code>js::RootedT</code>. A <code>js::RootedT</code> will automatically convert to a <code>js::HandleT</code>. By using <code>js::HandleT</code> in the interface instead of direct GCPointers, we ensure that the GCThing is already rooted on some previous stack frame, freeing us from having to worry about rooting the GCThing for the duration of the call.</p>

<pre>bool Hello(JSContext *cx, HandleObject foo)
{
    return Hello(cx, foo);
}

.....

void OtherFunction(JSContext *cx)
{
    ...
    RootedObject obj(cx, ...);
    Hello(cx, obj);
    ...
}</pre>

<p>A secondary benefit: since all JS functions take <code>js::HandleT</code>s, code that does not root CStack GCPointers correctly will be much less likely to compile.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: <code>js::HandleT</code> does not root objects itself! That is the job of <code>js::RootedT</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Never give a function a <code>js::HandleT</code> return type: this can easily lead to a <code>js::HandleT</code> outliving its <code>js::RootedT</code>'s lifetime.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="jsMutableHandle&lt;T>">js::MutableHandle&lt;T&gt;</h3>

<pre><strong>typedef JS::MutableHandle&lt;T&gt; js::MutableHandleT;</strong> -&gt; MutableHandleObject, MutableHandleString, etc.
</pre>

<p>The purpose of <code>js::MutableHandleT</code> is to allow out-parameters for rooted GCThings. This class solves two problems:</p>

<ol>
 <li>C++ only allows one level of user-defined implicit type conversion. When passed to an out-param, <code>&amp;handle</code> would convert correctly to <code>js::HandleT</code><code>*</code>, but <code>&amp;local</code> is a compile error.</li>
 <li>Even though <code>js::HandleT</code> is indirect, it implicitly behaves like the thing it is pointing to. This makes <code>js::HandleT</code> and <code>js::RootedT</code> behave the same, allowing us to seamlessly weave <code>js::HandleT</code>s into the JS API. The problem is that this requires us to overload <code>operator-&gt;</code>. If we have a method taking <code>Handle&lt;Value&gt;*</code>, then <code>out-&gt;setObject(foo)</code> will not work as expected.</li>
</ol>

<p>To solve these problems we have the <code>js::MutableHandleT</code> class. <code>js::MutableHandleT</code> is a <code>js::HandleT</code> with a <code>set</code> method.</p>

<pre>bool ReturnFoo(JSContext *cx, MutableHandleString out)
{
    out.set(JS_NewStringCopyZ(cx, "Foo"));
    return bool(out);
}

size_t GetLengthFoo(JSContext *cx)
{
    RootedString s(cx);
    if (ReturnFoo(cx, &amp;s))
        return JS_GetStringLength(s);
    return size_t(-1);
}
</pre>

<p>All methods in the JS-API that return GCPointers have been changed to this out-param style. This prevents an entire class of bugs where return values are not rooted properly before the next JS-API call.</p>

<h3 id="JSNullPtr">JS::NullPtr</h3>

<p>NULL (or nullptr) does not implicitly convert to a <code>js::HandleT</code>. For places where you want to pass a <code>NULL</code> value into a function taking a <code>js::HandleT</code>, you can construct and pass a new <code>NullPtr</code> instance. You are free to use these as temporaries.</p>

<pre>RootedObject obj(cx, JS_NewObject(cx, clasp, NullPtr(), NullPtr());
</pre>

<h2 id="Common_Pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h2>

<p>The C++ type system allows us to eliminate the possibility of most common errors; however, there are still a few things that you can get wrong that the compiler cannot help you with. There is basically never a good reason to do any of these. If you think you do need to do one of these, ask on one of SpiderMonkey's support forums: maybe we've already solved your problem using a different mechanism.</p>

<ol>
 <li><strong>Storing a </strong><code>js::RootedT</code><strong> on the heap.</strong> It would be very easy to violate the LIFO constraint if you did this. Use a different rooting mechanism if you store a GCPointer on the heap. There are MOZ_STACK_CLASS annotations that will cause a separate static analysis to fail if these are detected.</li>
 <li><strong>Storing a </strong><code>js::HandleT</code><strong> on the heap.</strong> It is very easy for the handle to outlive its root if you do this. Again, there are annotations with MOZ_STACK_CLASS.</li>
 <li><strong>Returning a </strong><code>js::HandleT</code><strong> from a function.</strong> If you do this, a handle may outlive its root.</li>

<h2 id="Caveats">Caveats</h2>

<h3 id="Exact_Rooting_Transition_Period">Exact Rooting Transition Period</h3>

<p>Exact stack rooting is not currently enabled by default: we are still using conservative scanning. Until the system described above has 100% browser coverage, it is unsafe to enable it. In the meantime, the <code>js::RootedT</code> class holds an object live by storing its pointer on the stack so that the conservative scanner will find it. This distinction should not be noticable to the end user.</p>

<h2 id="Performance_Tweaking">Performance Tweaking</h2>

<p>In aggregate, exact and conservate stack rooting should have similar performance. The performance tradeoffs that these techniques make, however, are quite different. If the extra overhead of exact rooting does end up adding an unacceptable cost to a specific code path that is not mitigated by a faster GC, there are some tricks you can use to get better performance at the cost of more complex code.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Move <code>js::RootedT</code> declarations above loops. Modern C++ compilers are not smart enough to do LICM on <code>js::RootedT</code>, so forward declaring a single <code>js::RootedT</code> above the loop and re-using it on every iteration can save some cycles.</li>
 <li>Raw pointers. If you are 100% sure that there is no way for SpiderMonkey to GC while the pointer is on the stack, this is an option. Note: SpiderMonkey can GC because of any error, GC because of timers, GC because we are low on memory, GC because of environment variables, GC because of cosmic rays, etc. This is not a terribly safe option for embedder code, so only consider this as a very last resort.</li>
</ul>
