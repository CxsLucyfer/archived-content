<h4 id="Building_Dehydra" name="Building_Dehydra">Building JSHydra</h4>

<p>JSHydra requires, as part of its build process, SpiderMonkey. By default, the configure script will obtain a known working copy of SpiderMonkey; it is possible via the <code>--moz-src and --moz-obj</code> configure arguments to tell JSHydra to use existing copies of the source and build.</p>

<h3 id="Usage" name="Usage">Processing input files</h3>

<p>JSHydra requires the files it processes to be correct JS files. Converting HTML, XUL, or XBL files into a readable JS equivalent is a work in progress, as is accounting for the preprocessing that Mozilla files sometimes use. There is not yet a repository for this information, but <code><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506128" title="run jshydra to find js functions that have no callers">bug 506128</a></code> contains more information.</p>
