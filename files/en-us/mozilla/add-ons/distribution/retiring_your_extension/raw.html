<p>There may be occasions where you want to retire one of your extensions. This article suggests the steps you might want to follow, as well as offering some pointers to a suitable timeline.</p>

<h2 id="Reasons_for_withdrawing_an_extension">Reasons for withdrawing an extension</h2>

<p>There are two main reasons why you might want to end-of-life your extension:</p>

<ul>
 <li>you plan to remove support for a product or service. In this case, you’ll want to remove the extension from browsers when support ceases.</li>
 <li>you're replacing the extension with a new one, which isn't a direct upgrade. In this case, you'll want to encourage existing users to install the new extension, before you remove the old extension from browsers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Steps_to_retiring_an_extension">Steps to retiring an extension</h2>

<p>When you want to withdraw an extension, considered taking the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Devise a timetable for your extension’s end-of-life<br>
  Consider including the following steps in a timetable for withdrawing your extension:
  <ol>
   <li>publish your extension’s end-of-life timetable, including an explanation of why you're retiring your extension.</li>
   <li>publish an update that removes installed copies of your extension.</li>
   <li>make the extension unavailable for new installs, by making its AMO listing invisible.</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Publish advice that you're planning to end-of-life your extension<br>
  Consider the following options to advise people of your intention to take down your extension:
  <ol>
   <li>update your extension’s AMO page with its end-of-life timetable.</li>
   <li>if your extension is being superseded by another, provide a link to the new extension. You could use {{WebExtAPIRef("management.onInstalled")}} to listen for installation of the new extension to trigger the removal of the original extension using {{WebExtAPIRef("management.uninstallSelf")}}.</li>
   <li>communicate the timetable through social media, forums, or where possible by email.</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Publish a final, self-removing version of your extension<br>
  Use {{WebExtAPIRef("management.uninstallSelf")}} to cause your extension to uninstall itself. Before it does, provide a notice reminding the user about the removal of the extension. If your extension is being superseded by another, remember to provide a reminder about the link to the new extension. You might offer the user the option to remove the extension now or in a few days time.</li>
 <li>Make your AMO listing invisible to prevent new installs<br>
  To hide your extension’s AMO listing:
  <ol>
   <li>open your extension’s listing in AMO.</li>
   <li>from the sidebar menu, open <strong>Manage Status &amp; Versions</strong>.</li>
   <li>In the Listing Visibility section, click <strong>Invisible</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<p>Your hidden extension will not be available either to a search of AMO or an attempt to access it directly using the page’s AMO URL.</p>

<h2 id="Suggested_retirement_timetable">Suggested retirement timetable</h2>

<p>There is no ideal period between publication of your end-of-life timetable and the removal of your extension from users’ browsers. In setting the timetable, you might wish to consider:</p>

<ul>
 <li>if you’re not providing a replacement extension, you could consider a relatively short notice period, perhaps a couple of weeks.</li>
 <li>if you’re replacing the extension with an alternative version, you may wish to provide a longer notice period, with regular reminders about the new extension. In this case, you might want to leave weeks or months between the initial end-of-life advice and the final removal of installed copies.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you’ve started retiring the extension, use the active user statistics on AMO to fine-tune your timing. For example, if the number of active users isn't declining significantly you may want to delay deploying your extension’s final version and send out a reminder about your plans. To access the active user statistics, open your extension in the AMO Developer Hub and click <strong>View Statistics Dashboard</strong> on the shortcut menu.</p>
