<p>This article walks through the process of publishing an add-on. If you just want to get started, head to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/submit/">Submit a New Add-on</a> page on AMO.</p>

<p>To start, familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/AMO/Policy/Reviews" style="text-decoration: none;">Add-on Policies</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/AMO/Policy/Agreement" style="text-decoration: none;">Developer Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>Next, prepare your add-on for publication by adding all its files to a ZIP archive with the extension .zip, .xpi, .crx, or .xml. For information on how to create your ZIP, see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Package_your_extension_">Package your extension,</a> and for details on what to include in the file, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension">Anatomy of an extension</a>.</p>

<div class="note">The maximum file size accepted is 200 MB. If your add-on is larger than 200 MB, it will fail validation.</div>

<p>If your add-on includes code that might be difficult to read, such as code created by minification or obfuscation, create a source code package. For more information on this requirement, see <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/Source_Code_Submission">Source Code Submission</a>.</p>

<p>Create your developer account on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">https://addons.mozilla.org</a> (AMO):</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you have a Firefox Account, connect it with AMO: visit AMO, in the page header click <strong>Log in</strong>, then log in with your Firefox Account.</li>
	<li>If you don't have a Firefox Account: visit AMO and, in the page header, click <strong>Register</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/" style="text-decoration: none;">Add-ons Developer Hub</a> and click <strong>Submit Your First Add-on</strong> or <strong>Submit a New Add-on</strong>. You'll reach the following page:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>On this site</strong>, if you want your add-on listed on AMO.<br>
	Click <strong>Continue</strong> and follow the <a href="#Listing_on_AMO">Listing on AMO</a> guide to find out how.</li>
