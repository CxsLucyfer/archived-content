<p>The Mozilla codebase used to have a notion of "external" strings, which were the string classes visible to code outside of the Mozilla codebase (Extensions, XULRunner applications, and embedders). These classes were removed a long time ago. The only remaining string classes are the "internal" ones, which are documented <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Guide/Internal_strings">XPCOM Guide Internal strings</a>.</p>
