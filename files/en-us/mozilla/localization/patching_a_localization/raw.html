<p>Say you have found a problem with an existing localization. More specifically, it's a problem with an already released localization. What do you do now? Well, you have come to the right place! This page will walk you through creating a patch for an existing localization. The steps below are fairly generic; for the most part they apply to creating l10n patches for Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, or Calendar.</p>
<p>I'll use Firefox in the example below to help you understand the general steps to creating a l10n patch.</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisites" name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>If you are to the point that you are patching existing localizations, we assume that you have the basic set of tools listed on the <a href="/en/Localization_prerequisites" title="en/L10n_Prerequisites">L10n Prerequisites</a> wiki page. If you do not have these tools, take a few steps back, grab a cookie (because, let's face it, you deserve it for all of your work), and visit the <a href="/en/Localization_prerequisites" title="en/Localization_prerequisites">L10n Prerequisites</a> page. There you'll learn what tools you need, where to find them, and how to install them.</p>
<h2 id="Get_the_source" name="Get_the_source">Get the source</h2>
<p>First, you need to get the source for the localization in question using its two or three character ISO language code. For our example, I'll use <span style="color: #0000ff;"><code>gl</code></span> (Galician). Whenever you see <span style="color: #0000ff;"><code>gl</code></span> in blue text, replace it with the locale code for your language.</p>
<p>Next thing you need to know is which localization version you want to patch. All of our localizations work on the Aurora branch. The repository for this version is <code>releases/l10n/mozilla-aurora</code>. For more information about branches see <a class="external" href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Branches" title="http://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Branches">L10n:Branches</a>.</p>
<p>Now let's get a little more detailed. Start bash and do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a clean directory for your work. For example, create a directory like <code>localization-workdir</code> (in this example it is located in your home directory):</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<pre>mkdir ~/localization-workdir
</pre>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Navigate to the directory you just created.</li>
</ol>
<pre>cd ~/localization-workdir</pre>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Clone the localization repository for your locale and for the version you want to patch:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="eval">hg clone <a class="external" href="http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-aurora/" rel="freelink">http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-aurora/</a><span style="color: #0000ff;"><code>gl</code></span>
</pre>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Now that you have the code and your working directory, edit the DTD and properties files to make your necessary changes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Creating_a_patch" name="Creating_a_patch">Creating a l10n patch</h2>
<p>You've made your changes, now create your patch.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to your working localization directory.</li>
</ol>
<pre>cd ~/localization-workdir/<span style="color: #0000ff;">gl</span>
</pre>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Create a patch (also known as a diff) using the <code>diff</code> command.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="eval">hg diff
</pre>
<p>This command creates a patch and lists your modifications through displaying the differences in a unified patch's files. These modifications are printed to stdout (standard output).</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Visually inspect your modifications. A good patch only contains those changes that you intended to make. If it contains more, you'll likely regress something else.</li>
</ol>
<p style="">     Alternatively, you can select specific files for <code>diff</code> to evaluate and print (see below). The command will only print the differences found in the selected files.</p>
<pre>hg diff browser/chrome/browser/browser.dtd
</pre>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Attach the patch to an existing bug for reference or review or <a class="link-https" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mozilla%20Localizations" title="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mozilla Localizations">create a new one</a> if one doesn't currently exist.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="eval">hg diff &gt; path/to/patchfile
</pre>
