The goal of the standard is to have an XML-based format to use when exchanging localization data between tools without the potential of data loss or corruption. Most translation tools support the XLIFF standard, making localizing the XLIFF files for Firefox for iOS easy to do using translation tools. Editing the raw XLIFF file is also rather easy, especially if you&apos;re already familiar with XML.
