<p>Once you have your l10n testing environment set up in Xcode, testing your Firefox on iOS localization is a breeze.<img alt="XLIFF diff screen (step 4)" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/10259/xliff_diff.png" style="float: right; width: 519px; height: 298px;"></p>

<ol>
 <li>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios#building-the-code">cloning and building instructions for Firefox on iOS</a>.</li>
 <li>Open the <code>Client.xcodeproj</code> file in Xcode.</li>
 <li>Select the <strong>Client</strong> project in the left pane and choose <strong>Editor</strong> &gt; <strong>Import Localizations</strong> from the toolbar and select your localized XLIFF file.</li>
 <li>A window will then appear showing the diff between the imported XLIFF file and the existing resources in the project folder. Click the <strong>I</strong><strong>mport</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Xcode will import your translated strings into the project by adding them to the project folder and replacing the existing strings.<img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/10257/application_localizaiton.png" style="width: 494px; height: 275px; float: right;"></p>

<p>Next, you need to configure the iOS app simulator to run the app in your locale.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Choose <strong>Product</strong> &gt; <strong>Scheme</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit Scheme</strong> from the toolbar menu.</li>
 <li>In the <strong>Edit Scheme</strong> screen, select <strong>Run</strong> from the left pane and then navigate to the <strong>Options</strong> tab.</li>
 <li>Select your language from the <strong>Application Language</strong> menu and click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tah dah! You're ready to test your localization of Firefox on iOS.</p>

<p>The iOS Simulator is fairly easy to use once you launch your app. To perform the next steps, you'll need to be familiar with how user gestures and hardware interactions work in the simulator. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/iOS_Simulator_Guide/InteractingwiththeiOSSimulator/InteractingwiththeiOSSimulator.html">This guide</a> should help.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Press the <strong>Run</strong> button in the upper left-hand corner (the button has a playback icon).</li>
 <li>Navigate to the newly opened <strong>iOS Simulator</strong> window</li>
 <li>Many strings are accessibility strings and are only revieled when a user hovers their finger over the button. To view these strings, you'll need to start the <strong>Accessibility Inspector</strong> within the iOS Simulator by doing the following.
  <ol>
   <li>In the <strong>iOS Simulator</strong>, press the <strong>Home</strong> button from the <strong>Hardware</strong> toolbar menu.</li>
   <li>Navigate to the <strong>Settings</strong> app, open it, and go to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li>
   <li>Slide the <strong>Accessibility Inspector</strong> switch to <strong>On</strong>. The <strong>Accessibility Inspector</strong> remains active until you turn it off, even if you quit and restart iOS Simulator.</li>
   <li>Press the <strong>Home</strong> button again, navigate to the pane with your <strong>Firefox for iOS</strong> localization on it, and reopen <strong>Firefox</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Now, you can navigate through the <strong>Firefox</strong> app in the <strong>iOS Simulator</strong>, viewing both UI elements and accessibility strings as you go.</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations, now your testing your app! See, that wasn't so hard, right?</p>
