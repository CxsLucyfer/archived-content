<p><span class="seoSummary">Localizers usually work on the localizable files without the context of the source files including the localized strings; it is important to add comments to the localizable files themselves, too. These comments are generally referred to as <em>localization notes</em>. There is an established format for those, which is described in this document.</span></p>
<p>It's important to follow the format as closely as possible. There are a number of automated tools that parse these comments for easier access and use by localizers.</p>
<h2 id="DTD_files">DTD files</h2>
<pre class="eval">&lt;!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (entity name): comment --&gt;
</pre>
<h2 id="Properties_files">Properties files</h2>
<pre class="eval"># LOCALIZATION NOTE (key): comment
</pre>
<p>File-wide comments should use the same format, be at the top of the file (after the license header, though) and just drop the <em>(entity name/key)</em> reference.</p>
