Note: These instructions are for Mozilla 1.9 (Firefox 3). You may want to read the <a href="/en/Mozilla_MathML_Project/Fonts" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla_MathML_Project/Fonts">most recent documentation</a> instead.</div>
<h2 id="STIX_Fonts">STIX Fonts</h2>
<p>The <a class="external" href="http://www.stixfonts.org/">STIX Fonts Project</a> has been developing a comprehensive set of fonts that cover all the symbols in MathML. A copy of these fonts is provided on this wiki and should be installed for best MathML rendering. You should download a <a href="/@api/deki/files/4719/=STIX-mozilla1.9.zip" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/4719/=STIX-mozilla1.9.zip">Zip archive of STIX fonts 1.0 + additional fonts from STIX Beta</a>. Indeed, even if STIX fonts 1.0 are already installed on your system, you need the STIXSiz*.odf fonts provided in this archive.</p>
<h2 id="Resetting_Old_Setup">Resetting Old Setup</h2>
<p>If users have previously changed the "font.mathfont-family" preference for a previous version of Mozilla, then it is best to reset this to the default value. To do this, enter the URL "about:config", "Filter" for "mathfont", and "Reset" to the default value through the context menu on the preference.</p>
<p>It may be best to uninstall BaKoMa TrueType Computer Modern fonts if these have been installed (perhaps for a previous version of Mozilla) because these fonts use a character encoding that is <a class="link-https" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400938#c0">inconsistent with Unicode recommendations</a>. These fonts are not normally used, and thus may not cause problems, but if a document explicitly requests font-family "CMSY10" or "CMEX10" or similar, and the BaKoMa fonts are installed, then they will get used, which will likely result in the wrong symbols being shown.</p>
