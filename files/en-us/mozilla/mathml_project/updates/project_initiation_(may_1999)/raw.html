<p>Both the output and input of <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/Math"><abbr>MathML</abbr></a> will be investigated in this project.</p>
<ul> <li>The priority of the project will be to provide a compact and fast engine that will process MathML and enable Gecko to render mathematical expressions <code>&lt;math&gt;...&lt;/math&gt;</code> in graphical form.</li> <li> <p>Another goal is to provide a <abbr>WYSIWYG</abbr> interface to <abbr>MathML</abbr>. This will be a graphical equation editor with an internal representation in standard MathML text. It will therefore provide a basis for:</p> <ul> <li>an equation editor button on Composer;</li> <li> <p>the support of an input field</p> <pre class="code example">&lt;form&gt;
 &lt;object type="application/mathml+xml"&gt;...&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Transformation Services are also <span class="external">of interest</span>. The <em>lingua franca</em> for formula-intensive documents is <a class="external" href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX/LaTeX</a> and the use of <abbr>MathML</abbr> is not yet widespread. Hence it would be useful to have a TeX-to-MathML equation converter. There are other notations for which converters to <abbr>MathML</abbr> can be useful. In order to keep the core <abbr>MathML</abbr> engine compact and fast, no format other than <abbr>MathML</abbr> will be supported. It is envisaged that proper modular design principles will be adopted so that interested parties can contribute separate converters which can be chained to the core <abbr>MathML</abbr> engine. This will provide a better alternative to cumbersome inline <abbr>GIF</abbr>s and Java applets that are often used to represent equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>A mathematical expression can be represented as an aggregate set of boxes. These are the bounding boxes that would enclose mathematical entities (literal symbol, operator, delimiter, <abbr>etc</abbr>). With rules governing the positioning of these entities (subscript, superscript, fraction, <abbr>etc</abbr>), it is possible to construct the box-model in a recursive manner by traversing the parsing tree of the expression.</p>
<p>With the object-oriented paradigm, each box can be viewed as an object that has its own specific properties and shares a common set of properties with other objects. With the <abbr>CSS</abbr> paradigm, each box can be viewed as a <abbr>CSS</abbr> frame that possibly embeds other <abbr>CSS</abbr> frames. Hence there is a direct correspondence between the two paradigms.</p>
<p><abbr>MathML</abbr> offers two formats for representing an equation: <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chap3_1.html">presentational tags</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chap4_1.html">semantic/content tags</a>. Given an equation in either format, the <abbr>MathML</abbr> project will ultimately aim at constructing a lump of CSS frames that can then be passed onto Gecko for layout and display.</p>
<p>The graphical input component of the project will seek to provide a point-and-click authoring tool for creating and editing mathematical expressions. But beneath the graphical outward appearance, there will be plain <abbr>MathML</abbr> text that could therefore go in Composer or in the input field of a form.</p>
<p>What about style sheets, JavaScripting, cut'n paste and the likes? As you see, in addition to getting the foundation right, there are many open issues to the project awaiting your input and help!</p>
