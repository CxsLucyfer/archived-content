 <p>TraceMalloc has been superseded by <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/DMD">DMD</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1014341">removed</a> from the codebase. This documentation is only relevant to older versions of the codebase that still contain it.</p>

<p>TraceMalloc captures stack traces of all <code>malloc</code>, <code>calloc</code> , <code>realloc</code>, and <code>free</code> calls (this currently covers all <code>operator new</code> and <code>delete</code> calls in Mozilla, too). To enable TraceMalloc in your build, configure with <code>--enable-trace-malloc</code>. The built Mozilla application will support the following additional command-line options:</p>
<ul>
 <li><code>--trace-malloc</code> <em>filename</em>  The application will log allocation and deallocation events with stack traces in a binary format to the given file. If <em>filename</em> is -, nothing is written to a file, but TraceMalloc will be active and will track live allocations and their stack traces.</li>
 <li><code>--shutdown-leaks</code>=<em>filename</em>  On shutdown, the application will save live allocations (with stack traces) to the given file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tools such as bloatblame (<code>tools/trace-malloc/bloatblame.cpp</code>) can be used to process <em>filename</em>. Try running with the unified output format option, <code>-u</code>. The output is a large HTML file that hyperlinks ancestor and descendent libraries, classes, and functions that call into one another, attributing <code>malloc</code> blame up and down each graph. Bloatblame accumulates allocation counts and ignores <code>free</code> calls.</p>
<p>If you run with <code>--trace-malloc -</code>, your code can call NS_TraceMallocDumpAllocations(<em>pathname</em>) at opportune times, and a human-readable listing of the current heap, including stack traces for every allocation, will be written to <em>pathname</em>. This file can be post-processed by tools in <a class="external external-icon" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/trace-malloc">mozilla/tools/trace-malloc</a> as follows:</p>

 <li><a class="external external-icon" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/trace-malloc/histogram.pl">histogram.pl</a>, which produces a type histogram that can be diffed with <a class="external external-icon" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/trace-malloc/histogram-diff.sh">histogram-diff.sh</a> to produce output that looks like this:</li>

 <li><code>TraceMallocChangeLogFD(<em>logfd</em>)</code> - change the current log file to the one identified by <em>logfd</em>, returning the previous fd (so you can maintain a number of open files; keep their fds in a JS Array!).</li>
 <li><code>TraceMallocCloseLogFD(<em>logfd</em>)</code> - close the log file identified by <em>logfd</em>, flushing its buffer of any events first. If <em>logfd</em> identifies the current log file, change the current log file to the default log file given by the --trace-malloc command line argument.</li>
 <li><code>TraceMallocLogTimestamp(<em>caption</em>)</code> - log a timestamp event to the current log file, annotating the log even with the <em>caption</em> string.</li>

<h2 id="Analyzing_the_shutdown_log">Analyzing the shutdown log</h2>
<p>The shutdown log is a basic tool for finding memory leaks. The shutdown log contains the stack trace of every allocation that has not been deallocated by shutdown. Some of these are false positives, allocations that are truly needed until shutdown. Ideally, these would be freed explicitly, to make it easier to find real leaks using the shutdown log. Here is a how-to for analyzing the shutdown log, taken from the Tinderbox leak builds. This example is for MacOS; small modifications are needed for other platforms.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"># Run application with shutdown logging
# Note: Tinderbox leak tests use: python leaktest.py -- --trace-malloc malloc.log --shutdown-leaks=sdleak.log
# Note 2: It appears that the shutdown log is not recorded if --trace-malloc is given the - argument.
build/dist/Minefield.App/Contents/MacOS/firefox --trace-malloc /dev/null --shutdown-leaks=sdleak.log
# Convert raw log to text representation of call trees
perl source/tools/trace-malloc/diffbloatdump.pl --depth=15 --use-address /dev/null sdleak.log &gt; sdleak.tree.raw
# Frobulate trees to remove extraneous junk
perl source/tools/rb/fix-macosx-stack.pl sdleak.tree.raw &gt; sdleak.tree</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>leakstats</code> program to analyze a log for shutdown leaks. It will produce a report like the following.</p>
<pre>Leaks: 382739 bytes, 3465 allocations
Maximum Heap Size: 7751799 bytes
62095212 bytes were allocated in 391091 allocations.</pre>
<h2 id="Detecting_memory_usage_growth_in_a_running_process">Detecting memory usage growth in a running process</h2>
<p>To do this, dump the existing allocations to a file by calling the function TraceMallocDumpAllocations from JavaScript. You can use the following web page to do so.</p>
<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    var filename = window.prompt("Filename to log: ");
    if (filename)
      TraceMallocDumpAllocations(filename);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>One can then use the script <code>tools/trace-malloc/diffbloatdump.pl</code> to compare trace-malloc dumps before and after doing an action that might leak. If there are significant differences, it might be worth examining the call stacks for the destructors of the objects in question to see what is extending their lifetime. (This can be done by examining the unprocessed output of an XPCOM_MEM_REFCNT_LOG, one of the nsTraceRefcnt logs.) You should use the <code>--use-address</code> argument to <code>diffbloatdump.pl</code>, and then the diff tree can be run through <code>fix_linux_stack.py</code> or <code>fix_macosx_stack.py</code> as needed.</p>
<h2 id="Leaksoup">Leaksoup</h2>
<p>Leaksoup is a trace-malloc tool that analyzes the shutdown log. Because this log includes the contents of heap blocks, leaksoup can analyze the graph of live objects and determine which allocations are roots (within that graph, of course -- stack allocations and global variables don't count). Leaksoup also finds sets of objects that are rooted by a cycle (i.e., a set of reference counted objects that own references to each other in a cycle). However, it cannot distinguish between owning and non-owning pointers, which means that non-owning pointers that are nulled out by destructors may show up in leaksoup as cycles. However, despite that, it is probably the easiest way to determine what leak roots are present.</p>
<p>Run using
 <i>
  both</i>
 the <code>--trace-malloc</code> and <code>--shutdown-leaks</code> options. Ignore the allocations log, and run leaksoup over the memory dump (which is a dump of all allocations still live at shutdown) with a command such as <code>./run-mozilla.sh ./leaksoup sdleak.log &gt; sdleak.html</code>. This generates a
 <i>
  large</i>
 HTML file as output.</p>
<p>The output of leaksoup begins with all the leak roots, and then lists all the non-root allocations. The roots are either listed as single objects or as strongly connected components (minimal sets of nodes in the graph in which any node is reachable from all other nodes). (A strongly connected component with only one node is listed as a single object.) Any single object listed as a root is really a leak root, and any component listed as a root either (a) contains an object that is a root or (b) contains objects that form an ownership cycle that is a root.</p>
