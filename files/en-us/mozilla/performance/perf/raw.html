<p class="summary"><code>perf</code> is a powerful system-wide instrumentation service that is part of Linux. This article discusses how it can be relevant to power profiling.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Power_profiling_overview">power profiling overview</a> is worth reading at this point if you haven't already. It may make parts of this document easier to understand.</p>

<h2 id="Energy_estimates">Energy estimates</h2>

<p><code>perf</code> can access the Intel RAPL energy estimates. The following example shows how to invoke it for this purpose.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">sudo perf stat -a -r 1 \
    -e "power/energy-pkg/" \
    -e "power/energy-cores/" \
    -e "power/energy-gpu/" \
    -e "power/energy-ram/" \
    &lt;command&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>-a</code> is necessary; it means "all cores", and without it all the measurements will be zero. The <code>-r 1</code> means <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> is executed once; higher values can be used to get variations.</p>

<p>The output will look like the following.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

   51.58 Joules power/energy-pkg/     [100.00%]
   14.80 Joules power/energy-cores/   [100.00%]
    9.93 Joules power/energy-gpu/     [100.00%]
   27.38 Joules power/energy-ram/     [100.00%]

5.003049064 seconds time elapsed</pre>

<p>It's not clear from the output, but the following relationship holds.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">energy-pkg &gt;= energy-cores + energy-gpu</pre>

<p>The measurement is in Joules, which is usually less useful than Watts.</p>

<p>For these reasons <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/tools_power_rapl">rapl</a> is usually a better tool for measuring power consumption on Linux.</p>

<p><code>perf</code> can also be used to do <a href="http://robertovitillo.com/2014/02/04/idle-wakeups-are-evil/">high-context profiling of wakeups</a>.</p>
