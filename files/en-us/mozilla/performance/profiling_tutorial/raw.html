<p>With Off-Main-Thread-Compositing (OMTCompositing) drawing will happens on two threads (1) The content thread (2) The compositor thread. To capture a useful profile you will want collect a profile with at least these two threads. For example to profile scrolling in a particular app like Settings, Homescreen you will want to profile the main thread of these processes. The compositor lives in the b2g process. Thus use the following command line:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">./profile.sh start -p b2g -t Compositor</pre>
<p>Note that some root drawing happens in the b2g main thread like the status bar, background (Not the homescreen icons), lock screen. For this you will want to use this command:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">./profile.sh start -p b2g -t GeckoMain,Compositor</pre>
<p>Finally capture the combined profile using:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp">./profile.sh capture</pre>

<p>Highlight a range in the timeline and select the breadcrumb that appears near the top left.</p>
<h3 id="Select_a_sample_at_a_particular_time">Select a sample at a particular time</h3>
<p>Click on a sample in the timeline at a particular point to highligh that sample in the tree view</p>
<h3 id="Navigating_the_treeview">Navigating the treeview</h3>
<p>With the treeview selected you may use the arrow keys to navigate the tree view efficiently. Keep an eye on the timeline as the green region will shift indicating when you selection happen.</p>
<h3 id="Understanding_the_timeline">Understanding the timeline</h3>
<p>The timeline will show unselected samples in black or and selected samples in green. The timeline x axis is time and the y axis is stack depth *not cpu usage*! Using the timeline to understand how your select samples occured in time is very important. Blocky green</p>
<h3 id="Filtering_by_name">Filtering by name</h3>
<p>Select the filter box in the middle left and type in a case insensitive search like 'reflow'.</p>
<h3 id="Share_a_profile">Share a profile</h3>
<p>Click the share button in the bottom left to upload the profile a *public* cloud storage. This will returns a URL that you can share on bugzilla &amp; irc. This is useful if you need help from others to understand the performance profile.</p>
