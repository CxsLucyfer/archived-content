<div class="warning">
 <p>Xcode ceased to ship Shark in Xcode 4 (released March 14, 2011), so this documentation is largely obsolete. See (and please contribute to) the <a href="/en/Performance/Profiling_with_Instruments">Instruments documentation</a> instead. (Instruments replaced Shark in Xcode.)</p>
</div>
<p>Shark is now hard to get. It's still available as part of CHUD (Mar 23, 2009) in the developer downloads.</p>
<p>You may be able to get shark from here:</p>

<p>Click on developer tools, which should bring you to here:</p>
<p><a class="external" href="http://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wo/5.1.17.2.1.3.3.1.0.1.1.0.3.3.3.3.1" rel="freelink">http://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/Web....1.0.3.3.3.3.1</a></p>
<p>Where you will find CHUD 4.6.2, which includes Shark 4.6.2 (227.9).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this version does not seem to work with 64-bit kernels.</p>
<p>With new Macs it should come on the OS X DVD. This version, 4.7.3 (383), worked at first, but now no longer works:</p>
<p>11-05-31 3:52:50 PM    [0x0-0x18e18e].com.apple.chud.modularshark[90344]    WARNING: Length of the text section of com.apple.driver.AGPM 100.12.31 was reported to be 0xc000 (c pages) from the kernel, but we're using &lt;VMUSymbolicator: 0x19f49350&gt; (&lt;VMUArchitecture: 0x19f47ca0&gt; 0x1000007,0x3 64b - LittleEndian) /System/Library/Extensions/AppleGraphicsPowerManagement.kext/Contents/MacOS/AppleGraphicsPowerManagement that thinks the length is 0x9000 (9 pages). [-[KmodSymbolLookup _stretchedVersionOfSignature:withLocationReset:] (KmodSymbolLookup.m:708)]</p>
<p>It seems likely that Shark was broken by a kernel upgrade. I've filed an Apple bug report #9648225.</p>
<p>This problem was fixed for me by reinstalling XCode from the 10.6.6 DVD.</p>
