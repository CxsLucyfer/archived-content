<p>Leak Gauge is a tool that can be used to detect certain kinds of leaks in Gecko, including those involving documents, window objects, and docshells. It has two parts: instrumentation in Gecko that produces a log file, and a script to post-process the log file.</p>

<h2 id="Getting_a_log_file_2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Getting_a_log_file">Getting a log file</span></h2>

<p>To get a log file, run the browser with these settings:</p>

<pre class="notranslate">NSPR_LOG_MODULES=DOMLeak:5,DocumentLeak:5,nsDocShellLeak:5,NodeInfoManagerLeak:5
NSPR_LOG_FILE=nspr.log     # or any other filename of your choice
</pre>

<p>This overwrites any existing file named <code>nspr.log</code>. The browser runs with a negligible slowdown. For reliable results, exit the browser before post-processing the log file.</p>

<h2 id="Post-processing_the_log_file"><span class="mw-headline" id="Post-processing_a_log_file">Post-processing the log file</span></h2>

<p>Post-process the log file with <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/footprint/leak-gauge.pl?raw=1">tools/leak-gauge/leak-gauge.pl</a> or <a href="https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/tools/leak-gauge/leak-gauge.html?raw=1">tools/leak-gauge/leak-gauge.html</a>.</p>

<p>If there are no leaks, the output looks like this:</p>

<pre class="notranslate">Results of processing log leak.log :
Summary:
Leaked 0 out of 11 DOM Windows
Leaked 0 out of 44 documents
Leaked 0 out of 3 docshells
Leaked content nodes in 0 out of 0 documents
</pre>

<p>If there are leaks, the output looks like this:</p>

<pre class="notranslate">Results of processing log leak2.log :

Leaked outer window 2c6ead0 at address 2c6ead0.
