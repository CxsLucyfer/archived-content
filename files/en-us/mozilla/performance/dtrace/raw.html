<p class="summary"><code>dtrace</code> is a powerful Mac OS X kernel instrumentation system that can be used to profile wakeups. This article provides a light introduction to it.</p>

<h2 id="Invocation">Invocation</h2>

<p><code>dtrace</code> must be invoked as the super-user. A good starting command for profiling wakeups is the following.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">sudo dtrace -n 'mach_kernel::wakeup { @[ustack()] = count(); }' -p $FIREFOX_PID &gt; $OUTPUT_FILE
</pre>

<p>Let's break that down further.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The<code> -n</code> option combined with the <code>mach_kernel::wakeup</code> selects a <em>probe point</em>.  <code>mach_kernel</code> is the <em>module name</em> and <code>wakeup</code> is the <em>probe name</em>.  You can see a complete list of probes by running <code>sudo dtrace -l</code>.</li>
 <li>The code between the braces is run when the probe point is hit.  The above code counts unique stack traces when wakeups occur; <code>ustack</code> is short for "user stack", i.e. the stack of the userspace program executing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Run that command for a few seconds and then hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to interrupt it. <code>dtrace</code> will then print to the output file a number of stack traces, along with a wakeup count for each one. The ordering of the stack traces can be non-obvious, so look at them carefully.</p>

<p>Sometimes the stack trace has less information than one would like. It's unclear how to improve upon this.</p>
