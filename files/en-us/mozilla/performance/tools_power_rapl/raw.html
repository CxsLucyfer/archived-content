<p class="summary"><code>tools/power/rapl</code> (or <code>rapl</code> for short) is a command-line utility in the Mozilla tree that periodically reads and prints all available Intel RAPL power estimates. These are machine-wide estimates, so if you want to estimate the power consumption of a single program you should minimize other activity on the machine while measuring.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Power_profiling_overview">power profiling overview</a> is worth reading at this point if you haven't already. It may make parts of this document easier to understand.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Invocation">Invocation</h2>

<p>First, do a <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions">standard build of Firefox</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Mac">Mac</h3>

<p>On Mac, <code>rapl</code> can be run as follows.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">$OBJDIR/dist/bin/rapl</pre>

<h3 id="Linux">Linux</h3>

<p>On Linux, <code>rapl</code> can be run as root, as follows.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">sudo $OBJDIR/dist/bin/rapl</pre>

<p>Alternatively, it can be run without root privileges by setting the contents of <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/14227/do-i-need-root-admin-permissions-to-run-userspace-perf-tool-perf-events-ar">/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid</a> to 0. Note that if you do change this file, its contents may reset when the machine is next rebooted.</p>

<p>You must be running Linux kernel version 3.14 or later for <code>rapl</code> to work. Otherwise, it will fail with an error message explaining this requirement.</p>

<h3 id="Windows">Windows</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>rapl</code> does not work on Windows, and porting it would be difficult because Windows does not have APIs that allow easy access to the relevant model-specific registers.</p>

<h2 id="Output">Output</h2>

<p>The following is 10 seconds of output from a default invocation of <code>rapl</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">    total W = _pkg_ (cores + _gpu_ + other) + _ram_ W
#01  5.17 W =  1.78 ( 0.12 +  0.10 +  1.56) +  3.39 W
#02  9.43 W =  5.44 ( 1.44 +  1.20 +  2.80) +  3.98 W
#03 14.26 W = 10.21 ( 5.47 +  0.19 +  4.55) +  4.04 W
#04 10.02 W =  6.15 ( 2.62 +  0.43 +  3.10) +  3.86 W
#05 14.63 W = 10.43 ( 4.41 +  0.81 +  5.22) +  4.19 W
#06 11.16 W =  6.90 ( 1.91 +  1.68 +  3.31) +  4.26 W
#07  5.40 W =  1.97 ( 0.20 +  0.10 +  1.67) +  3.44 W
#08  5.17 W =  1.76 ( 0.07 +  0.08 +  1.60) +  3.41 W
#09  5.17 W =  1.76 ( 0.09 +  0.08 +  1.58) +  3.42 W
#10  8.13 W =  4.40 ( 1.55 +  0.11 +  2.74) +  3.73 W</pre>

<p>Things to note include the following.</p>

<ul>
 <li>All measurements are in Watts.</li>
 <li>The first line indicates the meaning of each column.</li>
 <li>The underscores in <code>_pkg_</code>, <code>_gpu_</code> and <code>_ram_</code> are present so that each column's name has five characters.</li>
 <li>The total power is the sum of the package power and the RAM power.</li>
 <li>The package estimate is divided into three parts: cores, GPU, and "other". "Other" is computed as the package power minus the cores power and GPU power.</li>
 <li>If the processor does not support GPU or RAM estimates then "<code> n/a </code>" will be printed in the relevant column instead of a number, and it will contribute zero to the total.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once sampling is finished — either because the user interrupted it, or because the requested number of samples has been taken — the following summary data is shown:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">10 samples taken over a period of 10.000 seconds

Distribution of 'total' values:
            mean =  8.85 W
         std dev =  3.50 W
  0th percentile =  5.17 W (min)
  5th percentile =  5.17 W
 25th percentile =  5.17 W
 50th percentile =  8.13 W
 75th percentile = 11.16 W
 95th percentile = 14.63 W
100th percentile = 14.63 W (max)</pre>

<p>The distribution data is omitted if there was zero or one samples taken.</p>

<h2 id="Options">Options</h2>

<ul>
 <li><code>-i --sample-interval</code>. The length of each sample in milliseconds. Defaults to 1000. A warning is given if you set it below 50 because that is likely to lead to inaccurate estimates.</li>
 <li><code>-n --sample-count</code>. The number of samples to take. The default is 0, which is interpreted as "unlimited".</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Combining_with_powermetrics">Combining with <code>powermetrics</code></h2>

<p>On Mac, you can use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/powermetrics#mach_power">mach power</a> command to run <code>rapl</code> in combination with <code>powermetrics</code> in a way that gives the most useful summary measurements for each of Firefox, Chrome and Safari.</p>
