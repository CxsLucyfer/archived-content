<h2 id="Profiling_local_builds">Profiling local builds</h2>

<p>As of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441051">March 2018</a>, profiling local builds on Windows should work out of the box, with full symbol information. In the past you had to need to run <code>mach buildsymbols</code> manually, but this is no longer needed. The profiler automatically reads symbols from the pdb files that are generated during the build process.</p>

<p>You probably need a 64 bit build of Firefox for this to work, though. It looks like we consume too much memory when creating the symbol table for this to work in 32 bit Firefox builds. Unfortunately, 32 bit is still the default when building Firefox locally. You need to add the lines <code>ac_add_options --target=x86_64-pc-mingw32</code> and <code>ac_add_options --host=x86_64-pc-mingw32</code> to your mozconfig in order to build a 64 bit build of Firefox.</p>

<p>If you would like to use the <a href="/en/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler">Gecko Profiler</a> with a local talos run of a local build of Firefox for Windows, you will need to point talos to a zipfile containing breakpad-style symbols for your build. Follow the steps below:</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>You only need to do this if you're on Windows and you've built Firefox yourself. For any official release of Firefox (Nightly, Beta, etc), you do not need to use these steps.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Make sure you don't have <code>ac_add_options --disable-crashreporter</code> in your Firefox .mozconfig file.</li>
 <li>If you're building a Beta or Release channel version, and you want proper C++ callstacks in your profiles, add <code>ac_add_options --enable-profiling</code> to your Firefox .mozconfig file. You don't need to do this if you're building Nightly, because <code>--enable-profiling</code> is the default on Nightly.</li>
 <li>Build Firefox as usual, e.g. using <code>./mach build</code>.</li>
 <li>Generate the Breakpad symbol files by running <code>./mach buildsymbols</code>: <a href="/en/Building_Firefox_with_Debug_Symbols#Breakpad_symbol_files" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Building_Firefox_with_Debug_Symbols#Breakpad_symbol_files">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Building_Firefox_with_Debug_Symbols#Breakpad_symbol_files</a></li>
 <li>This will have created symbols under <code>$OBJDIR/dist/</code> , named after the binary name, architecture and version, so something like <code>"firefox-40.0a1.en-US-win32.crashreporter-symbols.zip"</code><br>
  Point talos to this zipfile by passing its path to the<code> --symbolsPath </code>flag.</li>
