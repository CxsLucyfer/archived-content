<p>--disable-accelerated-2d-canvas will disable GPU canvas</p>
<p><br> Google has a page on using <a class=" external" href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/debugging/pix-for-windows" title="http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/debugging/pix-for-windows">PIX on Chrome</a>. Unfortunately, it requires using --single-process which crashes on startup for me.</p>
<p>To work around this I was able to record the GPU commands using apitrace. I copied the d3d9.dll into both C:\Users\jrmuizel\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome SxS\Application\22.0.1186.0 and C:\Users\jrmuizel\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome SxS\Application\. I'm not sure which is needed. I did TRACE_FILE=foo.txt and it created the trace file in "C:\Users\jrmuizel\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome SxS\Application\22.0.1183.0\foo.txt".  I needed to run Chrome using --no-sandbox.  I was then able to run PIX on d3dretrace.</p>
