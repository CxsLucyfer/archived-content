<p>You can do a full stream capture with PIX including being able to debug pixel shader in each frame, by using a custom setup where you set a per frame capture that does a full capture.</p>
<p>Sometimes PIX will get confused and stop working with the current device. In this case you can switch to "Force REF". Note: this will force the reference device for applications, not just PIX.</p>
