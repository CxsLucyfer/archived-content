<p>Testing your code is important! Before you can even get your code committed into the source tree, you have to test it, and larger patches have to have automated tests. These articles will help you master (and continue to excel at) testing Mozilla code.</p>

It uses a compile-time instrumentation to check all reads and writes during the execution. In addition, the runtime part replaces the <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> functions to check dynamically allocated memory. More information on how ASan works can be found on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizerAlgorithm" class="external" title="http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizerAlgorithm">the Address Sanitizer wiki</a>.</dd></dl></dl></div>

There are different types of coverage metrics (see also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">Wikipedia entry</a>), but when we speak of code coverage here, we usually mean line and branch coverage. This type of coverage is only concerned with hit counts for lines and branches.</dd><dt class="landingPageList"><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Testing/Valgrind_test_job">The Valgrind Test Job</a></dt><dd class="landingPageList">The Valgrind test job builds the browser and runs it under <a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a>, which can detect various common memory-related errors.Â  This job only runs on Linux64, which is the platform best suited to running Valgrind.</dd></dl></div>
