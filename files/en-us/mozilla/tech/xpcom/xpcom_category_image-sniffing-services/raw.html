<p>In versions of Firefox prior to Firefox 3, extensions could add decoders for new image types. However, such decoders relied on servers sending correct MIME types; images sent with incorrect MIME types would not be correctly displayed.</p>
<p>In Firefox 3, a new XPCOM category was added in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=391667" title="FIXED: imglib does not gracefully handle unknown images sent with incorrect MIME types">bugÂ 391667</a> to allow "third-party" XPCOM components to identify images based on their content. If Mozilla's built-in image code cannot identify an image, then any XPCOM components implementing the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIContentSniffer" title="">nsIContentSniffer</a></code> interface may register under the "image-sniffing-services" category, and will be queried to determine the MIME type of the image being downloaded.</p>
