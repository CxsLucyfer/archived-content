<p>If Mozilla decides to upgrade to a compiler that does not have the same ABI as the current version, any built component may fail. It is a possiblity that is introduced when upgrading to a new compiler without recompiling everything. Effectively, it is a different platform.
</p><p>What does this mean to you? If you build a component and it works fine in version 1.0 of Mozilla. If and when Mozilla upgrades the compiler they use, your component will have to be rebuilt against the same compiler.
</p><p>When you see a <code>@status FROZEN</code>, note that this means it should work as long as the component and xpcom are built with the same compiler ABI.
