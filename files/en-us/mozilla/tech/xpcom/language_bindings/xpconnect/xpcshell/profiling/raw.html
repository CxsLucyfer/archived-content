<p>Sometimes, you might want to get a performance profile of a certain piece of JavaScript (like an XPCOM module), to see which part takes the most time. You could use <a href="en/Venkman">Venkman</a> for that. But sometimes, Venkman gives too much noise (because it also profiles chrome code). Or you might want to have a more reproducible testcase. In those cases, an <a href="en/Xpcshell">xpcshell</a> script can help. You can just call the code you want to test. But then, you can't use the Venkman UI.</p>

<p>There is profiler in the tree that can profile xpcshell scripts. To use it, you need to enable it in your <a href="en/Configuring_Build_Options">mozconfig</a>:</p>
<pre class="eval"> ac_add_options --enable-xpctools
</pre>
<p>Now you can profile an entire script by setting the environment variable &lt;tt&gt;MOZILLA_JS_PROFILER_OUTPUT&lt;/tt&gt; to a filename where you want the output file. For example, on Linux or MacOSX you do:</p>
<pre class="eval">export MOZILLA_JS_PROFILER_OUTPUT=/tmp/profile.txt
</pre>
<p>Now, run the script using <a href="en/Xpcshell">xpcshell</a>. After running has finished, the output file will contain a profile. A profile will look like this:</p>
<pre class="eval"> <a class="external" rel="freelink">file:///Users/michiel/Mozilla/tree1/...js/calUtils.js</a>
     [2,25420] createDateTime() {60-62} 579 {min 0, max 3, avg 0, sum 427, self 427}
     [2,56810] cp_QI() {860-866} 835 {min 0, max 1, avg 0, sum 950, self 950}
</pre>
<p>The first line tells which file was profiled. Then, the next lines shows the amount of time spend in the functions in that file. The line consists of:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The compile count of the function;</li>
 <li>The call count of the function;</li>
 <li>The functions name;</li>
 <li>The starting line number;</li>
 <li>The ending line number;</li>
 <li>The function's size;</li>
 <li>The amount of time (in milliseconds) the fastest call took;</li>
 <li>The time of the slowest call;</li>
 <li>The average time spend;</li>
 <li>The total time;</li>
 <li>The time spend in the function itself is given (that is the total time excluding the time spend in functions called from this function).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Notes" name="Notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
 <li>You need a trunk build from after 2007-05-28. Using an earlier build will cause the profiler to hang</li>
 <li>The more adventurous can use the nsIXPCToolsProfiler.idl interface directly, but be aware that you must start the profiler before loading the files you want to profile (creating an instance of a component loads the file!)</li>
</ul>
