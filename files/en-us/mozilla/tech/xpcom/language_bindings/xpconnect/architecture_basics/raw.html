<p><strong>XPCOM</strong> is like <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model">COM, for Windows</a>. It lets you get pointers to components inside Mozilla, and it lets you talk about their interfaces as well.</p>

<p><strong>XPConnect</strong> is what lets <a href="/en-US/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> talk with Mozilla guts, the XPCOM system. You can imagine it like a bridge between JavaScript code, and Mozilla guts.</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/xpcshell">xpcshell</a> is a command line interface to Mozilla JavaScript. It's an interactive interpreter -- it gives you a shell that talks straight to Mozilla, via JavaScript's XPConnect bridge into it.</p>
