<p>Source code for all Mozilla projects hosted in the Mercurial repositories can be searched and viewed online using <a href="https://searchfox.org/">Searchfox</a>, a fast indexed search engine that runs on AWS.</p>

<p>Do not download the source code by crawling Searchfox; download a tarball (<a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Source_Code/Downloading_Source_Archives#Download">see instructions here</a>) or use <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Source_Code/Mercurial" title="En/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Mercurial">Mercurial</a>Â  instead.</p>

<p>Searchfox indexes multiple branches and modules.</p>

<p>Some other Searchfox roots of interest are:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a class="link-https" href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/">"mozilla-central"</a> contains current Firefox and Gecko development. Releases branch off of this repository. Also known as "Trunk" or "nightly".</li>
 <li><a class="external" href="https://searchfox.org/comm-central/source">"comm-central"</a> contains current Thunderbird, SeaMonkey and Calendar development. Also contains a mirror of mozilla-central. Releases branch off of this repository.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/en/Mozilla_Source_Code_Directory_Structure" title="en/Mozilla_Source_Code_Directory_Structure">Mozilla Source Code Directory Structure</a> has a short description of the code living in each source directory of the tree.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>To view the source code of a specific version, you can also download it. Each product produced by Mozilla is archived <a href="https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/">there</a>, together with its source code.</p>
