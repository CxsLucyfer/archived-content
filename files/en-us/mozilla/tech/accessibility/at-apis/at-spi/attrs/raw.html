<p class="summary"><span class="seoSummary">AT-SPI exposes object attributes by <code>Accessible::getAttributes</code> method.</span> Please refer to <a href="en/Accessibility/AT-APIs/Gecko/Attrs">Gecko attributes</a> to get the list of supported attributes. In addition, the object attribute "haspopup" is set to "true" when a widget, such as a button or link, has a popup associated with it. This is necessary only in ATK/AT-SPI where there is no HASPOPUP state.</p>
