<p><strong>Mork</strong> was the name David McCusker gave to a text file format at Netscape. It was used for address books and history files under Mozilla when the mail/news team first released an open source version of the mail user agent. It's still used currently but has been replaced in Firefox 3 by <a href="en/Places">Places</a>/SQLite (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=383833" title="FIXED: eliminate toolkit's mork-based history implementation">bugÂ 383833</a>).</p>

<p>The Mork name comes from the famous '80 TV series "Mork &amp; Mindy".</p>

<p>Mork uses markup in a plain text format to describe uninterpreted binary content. Describing Mork as a text format is slightly inaccurate.</p>

<p>Mork is really a binary format encoded in a stream of byte oriented markup. But the binary is escaped when needed to avoid confusing the plain text markup.</p>

<p>Mork does not understand Unicode, which looks like any other binary to Mork.</p>

<p>Mork was intended as a temporary open source stub implementation of the abstract MDB interface, which was a generalization of mail database features desired for the mail/news and address book clients.</p>

<p>However, even as a mere short term stub, Mork aimed to avoid pain points for users and developers:</p>

<ul>
 <li>avoid user data loss and corruption if and when incremental writes are interrupted</li>
 <li>avoid extreme unreadability by writing line-oriented output with continuations.</li>
 <li>avoid a fixed schema, and permit anything at all to be flexibly added later</li>
 <li>avoid extra bytes in markup whenever possible for i/o and space efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last goal could have been done better in the way binary is escaped. The early version was verbose given heavy doses of non-ascii octets. Adding base64 support was never a priority to management.</p>
