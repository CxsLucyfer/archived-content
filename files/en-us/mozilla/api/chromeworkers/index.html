<p>To complement the open Web Worker functionality, Mozilla has introduced the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChromeWorker" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>ChromeWorker</code></a> interface, which provides this capability within application chrome. That makes it available not only to the application itself, but also to add-ons.</p>

<p>This documentation covers chrome Workers and the chrome worker module loader.</p>
