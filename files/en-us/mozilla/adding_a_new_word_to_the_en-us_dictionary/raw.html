<p>Occasionally bugs are filed pointing out situations where perfectly legitimate words are missing from the English spell check dictionary in Firefox. This article describes the process for adding a word to the dictionary.</p>
<p>The process is pretty straight-forward:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get a clone of <a href="/en-US/docs/mozilla-central" title="/en-US/docs/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>, if you don't already have one, and make sure you can <a href="/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build" title="/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build">build it successfully</a>.</li>
  <li>Get into the dictionary sources directory using this command: <code>cd extensions/spellcheck/locales/en-US/hunspell/dictionary-sources</code></li>
  <li>There's a special script used for editing dictionaries. The script only works if you have the environment variable <code>EDITOR</code> set to the executable of an editor program; if you don't have it set, you can do <code>EDITOR=vim sh edit-dictionary</code> to edit using vim (or you can substitute some other editor), or you can just do <code>sh edit-dictionary</code> if you have an <code>EDITOR</code> already specified.</li>
  <li>Add and remove words in the dictionary file, then quit the editor.</li>
  <li><code>sh merge-dictionaries</code> to process the dictionary changes you've made.</li>
  <li>Move the revised dictionary file into position: <code>mv en-US.dic ..</code></li>
  <li>Build Firefox and test your updated dictionary. Once you're satisfied, <a href="/en-US/docs/Creating_a_patch" title="/en-US/docs/Creating_a_patch">create a patch</a> as usual, attach it to a bug, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/How_to_Submit_a_Patch#Getting_reviews" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/How_to_Submit_a_Patch#Getting_reviews">request review</a>.</li>
