<p>Gaia 2.1 and above contains facilities for running on TV. There have been smart TVs on the market running Firefox OS since mid 2015, the first of which is the <a href="http://www.panasonic.com/promos/learn/smart-viera/">Panasonic VIERA Smart TV</a>.</p>

<p>The newest version of Firefox OS (2.5) is currently available to partners and developers and adds some new features, which will be made available in the new range of Panasonic DX900 UHD TVs later this year. This update will include new ways to discover Web apps and save them to your TV, and sync Firefox features across TV and other platforms (such as bookmarks, etc.) Most prominent is a “send to TV” feature to easily share Web content from Firefox for Android to a Firefox OS powered TV.</p>

<p>The Firefox OS effort across TVs is part of the wider effort to provide Firefox OS as an open platform choice for managing and controlling the wider range of connected devices available in the physical world (i.e. the <em>Internet of Things</em>.) </p>

<p>In brief, the main differences between using Firefox OS on a TV versus a phone (or a desktop computer) are:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Control mechanisms</strong>: Firefox OS on TV likely only has a TV remote available to control it, which is not as convenient as a keyboard, mouse or touch screen.</li>
 <li><strong>Resolution</strong>: Modern smart TVs are usually Full HD (1920x1080) or Ultra HD (4K). The Device Pixel Ratio on TVs is also different to that of most mobile devices.</li>

<h2 id="API_support_on_TV">API support on TV</h2>

<p>Firefox OS for TV is based on Gecko, so therefore it supports most of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API">APIs</a> available for the web platform, and <a href="/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/Firefox_OS_apps/Firefox_OS_device_APIs">Firefox OS-specific APIs</a>. There are some exceptions, however, and this list outlines those:</p>

 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation">Geolocation</a>: Not supported on VIErA TV.</li>
