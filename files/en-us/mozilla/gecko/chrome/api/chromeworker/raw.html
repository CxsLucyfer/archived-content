      This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.</p>

<p>If you're developing privileged code, and would like to create a worker that can use <a href="/en/js-ctypes" title="en/js-ctypes">js-ctypes</a> to perform calls to native code, you can do so by using <code>ChromeWorker</code> instead of the standard <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker" title="The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker() constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread."><code>Worker</code></a> object. It works exactly like a standard <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker" title="The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker() constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread."><code>Worker</code></a>, except that it has access to <a href="/en/js-ctypes" title="en/js-ctypes">js-ctypes</a> via a global <code>ctypes</code> object available in the global scope of the worker. Examples of ChromeWorker's using js-ctypes are availabe on Github and are linked to from the <a href="#seealso">See Also section below</a>. To use a postMessage with callback version of ChromeWorker that features promises, see <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PromiseWorker">PromiseWorker</a>.</p>

<p>Addons must use absolute URLs to load their workers, and those URLs have to be using a <code>chrome://</code> or <code>resource://</code> protocol (<code>file://</code> is not accepted). Addons that wish to use <code>file://</code> URLs must first register a resource replacement path, using code like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var fileuri = Services.io.newFileURI(file);
Services.io.getProtocolHandler('resource').
              QueryInterface(Ci.nsIResProtocolHandler).
              setSubstitution('my-cool-addon', fileuri);
  var worker = new Worker('resource://my-cool-addon/worker.js');</pre>
