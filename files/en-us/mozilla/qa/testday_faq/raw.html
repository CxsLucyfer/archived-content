<h3 id="Why_do_we_need_Testdays">Why do we need Testdays?</h3>
<div>
 They provide us a unique opportunity to galvanize the community around a particular testing activity. The community is and has always been, one of the biggest contributors to Mozilla’s success. Without the support of our community, we would not be able to push Firefox and the Web forward at the speed and level of quality the world has come to expect.</div>

<div>
 There are multiple benefits; not least of which is being able to collaborate, have discussions, and share experiences with people who share your values. If you are a Firefox developer, it gives you the opportunity to get a lot of eyes on your work; get feedback, find bugs, and improve the quality. If you are student or a professional, it gives you the opportunity to build existing skills or learn new skills.</div>

<h3 id="Who_can_participate_in_Testdays">Who can participate in Testdays?</h3>
<div>
 Everyone. We welcome people of all backgrounds, locales, skills, and knowledge. The more diverse the participants, the better. This gives us a wider viewpoint on various issues and features, and gives us visibility into issues we may have missed. If you have no experience with testing, we always have people on hand who can teach you. If you already have some skills, we can provide you with tasks which will challenge you and allows you to grow your skills. The only requirement is that you are passionate about Firefox and have a desire to make it better.</div>
