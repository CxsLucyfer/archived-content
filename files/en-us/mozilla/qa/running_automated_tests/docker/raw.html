<p>Have you tried using the <a href="/en-US/docs/ Running_automated_tests/TaskCluster_interactive_session">interactive loaner</a>? It is the preferred and supported method.<br>
 Running tests via Docker on your localhost is not the supported approach.</p>

<p>If this is strongly wanted please <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Taskcluster&amp;component=General">file a bug</a> and the interactive loaner cannot be fixed to meet your needs we can prioritize it and see who can work on it.</p>
